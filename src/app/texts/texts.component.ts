			"significance": '<p>The tale of Bevis of Hampton is one of the best-travelled of insular romances. The narrative centres on a young English knight who performs great deeds of chivalry all over Europe and in the Islamic world. It appears to have been composed in Anglo-Norman the late twelfth or early thirteenth century. Two further adaptations were made from this version in continental French. These are significantly longer than the Anglo-Norman version and are the ultimate source of a number of further versions in continental European vernaculars.<a title="" name="_ftnref1" >[1]</a> Translations of the narrative can, therefore, be divided into two groups: those deriving from the versions in continental French, including adaptations in Dutch, Italian and Yiddish, and an insular translation derived, ultimately, from the Anglo-Norman <em>Boeve</em> .</p><p> </p><p>Versions of Bevis’s story survive in every major insular vernacular. The Anglo-Norman text provides the source for Welsh and Norse translations made in the middle of the thirteenth century and for an English version produced in the early fourteenth century. It is from this English text that an Irish translation is made in the late fifteenth century.</p><p> </p><p class="StandardCxSpFirst">This entry discusses the following versions of <em>Bevis</em> from the insular tradition:</p><p class="StandardCxSpMiddle">-      <em>Boeve de Haumtone </em> (Anglo-Norman verse, second half of the twelfth century)</p><p class="StandardCxSpMiddle">-      <em>Bevers saga </em> (Old Norse-Icelandic prose, c. 1250-c. 1350)</p><p class="StandardCxSpMiddle">-      <em>Ystorya Bown de Hamtwn </em> (Welsh prose, mid thirteenth century)</p><p class="StandardCxSpMiddle">-      <em>Sir Bevis of Hampton </em> (Middle English verse, early fourteenth century)</p><p class="StandardCxSpMiddle">-      <em>Stair Bibuis </em> (Early Modern Irish prose, late fifteenth century)</p><p class="StandardCxSpLast"> </p><p> </p><p><strong><span class="subtitle">Anglo-Norman version</span></strong></p><p>The anonymous Anglo-Norman <em>Boeve de Haumtone</em> has been described as an ‘ancestral romance’ and also as a <em>chanson de geste</em> – it is composed in the<em>laisse</em> form conventional to that genre.<a title="" name="_ftnref2" >[2]</a> Four manuscripts of the text came down into the modern era. All are fragmentary to some extent, though, between them, it is possible to reconstruct the full work.<a title="" name="_ftnref3" >[3]</a> The earliest, University of Glasgow, Hunterian Library, MS 466,is a fragment dating from the first half of the thirteenth century and is preserved as a pastedown.<a title="" name="_ftnref4" >[4]</a> It covers sixty-two lines of the narrative. London, Lambeth Palace, MS 1237, nos. 1, 2 contains two short fragments and dates from the second half of the thirteenth century.<a title="" name="_ftnref5" >[5]</a> A much more substantial portion of the work was preserved in Leuven, Universiteitsbibliotheek, MS G.170, ff. 53-130 (the Firmin Didot MS), also dating to the second half of the thirteenth century. This manuscript was destroyed during the Second World War, but had been edited by Albert Stimming in 1899. In this codex, <em>Boeve de Haumtone</em> was followed by an Anglo-Norman version of <em>Fierabras</em> . The two texts have certain narrative similarities, including the motif of the <em>belle sarrasine</em> . The final manuscript, Paris, Bibliotheque Nationalede France, MS nouvelle acqusitions français 4532, dates from the first half of the fourteenth century. <em>Boeve</em> is the only text in the manuscript and features a line-by-line English translation in an early modern hand.</p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle">Old Norse-Icelandic version</strong></p><p>The Norse translation, <em>Bevers saga</em>, survives in four medieval Icelandic manuscripts, two of them mere fragments, dating from the mid-fourteenth century onwards; however, the translation was probably originally made at some point after 1250.<a title="" name="_ftnref6" >[6]</a> It is difficult to determine whether the original translation was made in Norway or Iceland.<a title="" name="_ftnref7" >[7]</a> <em>Bevers saga</em> also circulated in Norway, as evidenced by a reference to a copy of the text in a 1366 library inventory from Ryfylke.<a title="" name="_ftnref8" >[8]</a> Christopher Sanders notes a heightened religiosity in this translation. <em>Bevers saga </em> exhibits ‘a certain intensifying of the Christian tone of the epic – and therefore, to some extent, of an anti-Islamic, or anti-pagan, undercurrent’.<a title="" name="_ftnref9" >[9]</a> He suggests a clerical translator for this text, based on the translation techniques employed.<a title="" name="_ftnref10" >[10]</a> </p><p> </p><p>The text seems to be associated with other chivalric narratives in the surviving manuscripts. <a href="https://handrit.is/en/manu" target="_blank"> Copenhagen, Arnamagnæan Institute, AM 567 II 4to</a> is the earliest text, dating from the fourteenth century.<a title="" name="_ftnref11" >[11]</a> Its fragment of <em>Bevers saga</em> is accompanied by fragments of three other Old Norse-Icelandic romances (<em>riddarasögur</em> ) of similar date. The remaining manuscripts date from the fifteenth century.<a title="" name="_ftnref12" >[12]</a> Two of these offer texts of the saga that are substantially complete. Like the earlier fragment, Stockholm, Royal Library, Perg. 4:o nr. 6 collects the work with various <em>riddarasögur </em> as does Stockholm, Royal Library, Perg. fol. nr 7.<a title="" name="_ftnref13" >[13]</a>  This latter manuscript includes translations of two other well-known French romances, <em>Ivens saga</em> (a translation of <em>Yvain</em> ) and <em>Parcevals saga</em> (<em>Perceval</em> ).<a title="" name="_ftnref14" >[14]</a> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle">Welsh Version</strong></p><p>The Welsh translation of <em>Bevis of Hampton</em>,<em>Ystorya Bown de Hamtwn,</em> has a similar chronological profile to the Norse adaptation; it is usually dated to not long after the middle of the thirteenth century.<a title="" name="_ftnref15" >[15]</a> There are also some similarities in the likely background to the Welsh and Norse <em>Bevis of Hampton</em> translations too. The editor of <em>Ystorya Bown de Hamtwn</em>, Morgan Watkin, notes that the translator of <em>Bown</em> has emphasised and amplified the religious dimension of the narrative and he suggests that the translator may have been a monk.<a title="" name="_ftnref16" >[16]</a> <em>Bown </em> dates from the ‘earliest phase’ of Welsh translations and Welsh versions of similar works, like the <em>Chanson de Roland</em> and the <em>Pèlerinage de Charlemagne</em>, were produced from French at around the same time.<a title="" name="_ftnref17" >[17]</a> </p><p> </p><p><em>Bown</em> survives in two medieval manuscripts: the Red Book of Hergest, dating from between 1382 and c. 1400, and the White Book (Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS Peniarth 5), from around 1350.<a title="" name="_ftnref18" >[18]</a> The Red Book was likely compiled for Hopcyn ap Tomas of Ynysforgan in Glamorgan. It passed from his descendants into the hands of the Vaughans of Tretŵr in 1465. The White Book was compiled for Rhydderch ab Ieuan Llwyd (c. 1325-1400) of Parcrhydderch in Ceredigion; however, the scribe was probably based at the Cistercian abbey at nearby Strata Florida. The Red Book and the White Book are very similar in content and both may well derive from a common source. The two copies of <em>Bown</em> agree very closely at most points. Intriguingly, the White Book features two different versions of the text’s opening lines. The first is abandoned after 49 lines and differs in various respects from the second opening, which agrees with that in the Red Book.<a title="" name="_ftnref19" >[19]</a> </p><p><em> </em> </p><p><strong class="subtitle">Middle English versions</strong></p><p>All indications are that the Middle English translation of <em>Boeve</em> was a particularly popular text.<a title="" name="_ftnref20" >[20]</a> It is a standard component in lists of well-known romances, such as that in Chaucer’s <em>Sir Thopas</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref21" >[21]</a> The first surviving copy is that in the Auchinleck manuscript compiled around 1330 and a further seven copies survive in full or in fragmentary form from the following two centuries. The work was also printed at an early point and remained popular in the chapbook tradition. The surviving versions of the narrative in Middle English differ in various ways from the Anglo-Norman version and their relationship to each other and to their source is difficult to unpick. The English versions also feature substantial episodes that do not appear in <em>Boeve</em>, including Bevis’s fight with a dragon at Cologne and a final episode where the citizens of London are incited against Bevis.<a title="" name="_ftnref22" >[22]</a> </p><p> </p><p>There is little firm evidence as to the owners of the surviving English manuscripts; however, two of them have been associated with female audiences.<a title="" name="_ftnref23" >[23]</a> <em>Bevis</em> is collected with other romances in a number of codices.<a title="" name="_ftnref24" >[24]</a> The most extensively studied is the Auchinleck manuscript, which features a high proportion of romances, including <em>Sir Guy of Warwick</em> and <em>Richard Coeur de Lion</em>, and a large number of translations from French.<a title="" name="_ftnref25" >[25]</a> London, British Library, MS Egerton 2862 is also largely a compilation of romances. Cambridge, University Library, MS Ff.2.38 includes nine romances among its forty-three texts and also features a high number of religious works.<a title="" name="_ftnref26" >[26]</a> Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College, MS 175/96 collects a similar mixture of romances and religious material.<a title="" name="_ftnref27" >[27]</a> These manuscript contexts seem to reflect the narrative emphases of <em>Bevis</em>, which is a tale of chivalric adventure with a pious flavour: Bevis’s exploits take him into the Islamic world and his story is, in many ways, a crusade narrative. </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle">Irish version</strong></p><p>The Irish translation of Bevis is the only insular translation that is not directly derived from the Anglo-Norman <em>Boeve</em> .<em>Stair Bibuis </em> appears to have been translated from a Middle English text by the prolific scribe and translator Uilliam Mac an Leagha.<a title="" name="_ftnref28" >[28]</a> The work survives in a unique holograph manuscript, Trinity College Dublin, MS 1298, alongside a translation of the similar work, <em>Sir Guy of Warwick</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref29" ><sup><sup>[29]</sup></sup></a> The translation dates from the late fifteenth century, a period in which a number of translations were made from English into Irish.<a title="" name="_ftnref30" ><sup><sup>[30]</sup></sup></a> The copy of <em>Stair Bibuis</em> in Trinity 1298 is incomplete at the end, but, as Jennifer Fellows has argued, is a fairly close match for the version of the romance preserved in Cambridge, University Library, MS Ff 2. 38 and Manchester, Chethams MS 8009, though it also has points of correspondence with the Auchinleck version of the text.<a title="" name="_ftnref31" ><sup><sup>[31]</sup></sup></a>  </p><p> </p><p>One episode in <em>Stair Bibuis </em> highlights the possible centrality of the work’s crusading theme to its Irish readers. For the most part, Uilliam Mac an Leagha’s translation follows the plot and narrative detail of surviving Middle English texts closely. However, there is one exception: in his Mediterranean travels, Bevis lands on Rhodes and spends some time with the Knights Hospitaller, fending off attacks on the island by Muslims and other non-Christians.<a title="" name="_ftnref32" ><sup><sup>[32]</sup></sup></a> Erich Poppe has suggested that the patron of the translation might have had connections to the Knights Hospitaller in Ireland.<a title="" name="_ftnref33" ><sup><sup>[33]</sup></sup></a>   If this is the case, the crusading dimension of <em>Bevis of Hampton</em> may well have been the primary reason for its translation into Irish. Bevis’s trip to Rhodes may also be read as a topical flourish, since the translation was probably made not long after the 1480 siege of Rhodes. The Fitzgeralds of Allen in Kildare, who owned Trinity 1298 and possibly commissioned the translation, had close ties to the Knights Hospitaller in this period.<a title="" name="_ftnref34" ><sup><sup>[34]</sup></sup></a> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle">Conclusion</strong></p><p>The considerable popularity of the Anglo-Norman <em>Boeve de Haumtone</em>, both in the insular world and in continental Europe may be owed, in part, to its emphasis on both chivalry and piety. Translations into Norse, Welsh and Irish have been associated with clerical translators, monastic scribes and with military orders. Other texts that were popular in translation, such as <em>Fierabras</em>, exhibit similar features and it seems plausible that such works may often have been transmitted via international religious networks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle">EDITIONS</strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Anglo-Norman versions</span></strong></p><p>Stimming, Albert, ed., <em>Der anglonormannische Boeve de Haumtone</em>, Bibliotheca Normannica 7 (Halle: Niemeyer, 1899; repr.

			"significance": '<p>The insular and continental reception of the <em>Prophecy of the Six Kings</em> must be understood in relation to the far-reaching appeal of Galfridian prophecy across late medieval Europe, as in the case of the <em>Prophetiae Merlini, </em> on which text the <em>Six Kings </em> draws heavily (see <strong><em>Prophecies of Merlin</em> </strong>). However, unlike the <em>Prophetiae, </em> there is no evidence of Scandinavian circulation, and the <em>Six Kings </em> appears to have had no purchase outside political contexts with a direct investment in the English accession. Drawing on motifs lifted from Geoffrey of Monmouth’s <em>Prophetiae Merlini, </em> the prophecy forecasts the reigns of the lamb (Henry III), the dragon (Edward I), the goat (Edward II), the boar (Edward III), and finally the ass, who is deposed by the mole (identified in the fifteenth century as Richard II and Henry IV), who is overthrown in turn by a lion from Ireland, dragon from the North and wolf from the west, who between them divide England, or Britain, in three. Although long associated by scholars with the Revolt of Owain Glyn Dŵr (in part because of Shakespeare’s references to the prophecy in <em>1 Henry IV</em> ), and even once ascribed a putative Welsh source, the prophecy is now recognised as a product of disillusionment in Edward II, written in support of his deposition and the accession of his young son, the future Edward III.<a title="" name="_ftnref1" >[1]</a> </p><p> </p><p>The prophecy survives in seven recensions, produced between 1333 and 1470, across four languages. As identified by Tim Smallwood, alongside the original version, these are termed:<a title="" name="_ftnref2" >[2]</a> </p><p> </p><p>1. <em>The Original Prose Version </em> (Anglo-Norman), c. 1312-27<a title="" name="_ftnref3" >[3]</a> </p><p>2. <em>The Revised Prose Version </em> (Anglo-Norman), incorporated in the <em>Brut</em>, c. 1333.</p><p>3. <em>The English Prose Version</em>, translated with the rest of the <em>Brut </em> into English, c. 1370-1400<a title="" name="_ftnref4" >[4]</a> </p><p>4. <em>The English Couplet Version, </em> c. 1370-80</p><p>5. <em>The First Revised Couplet Version, </em> c. 1400-1450</p><p>6. <em>The Second Revised Couplet Version, </em> c. 1450</p><p>7. <em>The Welsh Prose Translation, </em> c. 1450 (there are in fact two separate Welsh prose translations from this period).<a title="" name="_ftnref5" >[5]</a> </p><p>8. <em>The Latin Version, </em> c. 1415-1470. </p><p> </p><p>There are three significant translation and cross-border transmission movements of particular note for the present project, all of which (judging from extant manuscripts) belong to the second half of the fifteenth century: 1. the circulation of the prophecy in continental Europe among English or Burgundian partisans in the context of the Hundred Years War; 2. Welsh translations and English-language adaptations of the prophecy in Wales in the context of the Wars of the Roses; 3. the translation of the prophecy into Latin in England, similarly during the Wars of the Roses. The French, Welsh and Latin contexts of the prophecy are discussed below. This entry does not address the translation of the original text from Anglo-Norman into Middle English, the readership and circumstances of which have been traced, in the context of the Middle English <em>Brut</em>, by Lister M. Matheson.<a title="" name="_ftnref6" >[6]</a> The only witness of particular note among the English Prose Version, in terms of its cross-border circulation (in addition to manuscripts in Herefordshire and Welsh circulation, noted below), is Glasgow, University of Glasgow, Hunterian MS 83 (1), which has been understood to be in a Scottish scribal hand, although the dialect has been localised in northern England.<a title="" name="_ftnref7" >[7]</a> This is the only witness of the prophecy with a known Scottish connection. </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">French & Continental Transmission History</span></strong></p><p>The continental transmission of the <em>Six Kings</em> is one facet of its association with the <em>Brut </em> tradition. The <em>Revised Prose Version</em> <em>of the Six Kings </em> was incorporated in the long version of the Anglo-Norman<em>Brut </em> (extending to 1333), which circulated in continental Europe as well as England, although the prophecies are not found in all manuscripts. All three of the continental manuscripts detailed for the <em>Six Kings </em> on the database are mid-late fifteenth-century copies of the <em>Brut</em>. Like the <em>Brut</em> itself, this must be situated in the broader context of the partisan literature of the Hundred Years War, and was presumably received in France as anti-French pro-Burgundian or English content. An anti-French utility is a function of the prophecy from its earliest versions, which incorporates a vision of the English conquest of Paris, by a boar (originally read as Edward III but subsequently applied to later kings of England), who whets his teeth on Paris’s gates: ‘anguisera ces dentz sur les portes de Paris’ (London, British Library, MS Harley 746, f. 2r; <em>Original Prose Version, </em> my transcription). It has been speculatively proposed that Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS français 12155 was produced in Flanders either for Louis de Gruuthuse (supporter of Edward IV, and from 1472, the Earl of Winchester), or the dukes of Burgundy.<a title="" name="_ftnref8" >[8]</a> This sits interestingly with what we know of the circulation of the prophecy in Yorkist circles during this period. This line of affinity does seem to have facilitated the transmission of Galfridian material at the Burgundian court in the late fifteenth century – among the manuscripts owned by Louis is Jean de Wavrin’s <em>Recueil,</em> which incorporates a French prose translation of Geoffrey’s <em>Historia </em> and <em>Prophecies</em>, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS français 74-85 (c. 1475).</p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Welsh Translation</span></strong></p><p>Two Welsh prose translations were produced, seemingly independently of one another, in the mid-fifteenth century. <a title="" name="_ftnref9" >[9]</a> Given the extensive level of adaptation, it is impossible to tell whether these are derived from the Anglo-Norman<em>Revised Prose Version</em> or the <em>English Prose Translation</em>. The longer of the two, <em>Darogan Chwe Brenin </em> (‘Prophecy of the Six Kings’), appears in Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS Peniarth 50 (c. 1445-56) alongside English, Welsh and Latin prophecies. The manuscript, which may have been compiled at Neath Abbey in Glamorgan, includes Yorkist and proto-Yorkist material, both in English and in Welsh translation, alongside Welsh prophecies.<a title="" name="_ftnref10" >[10]</a> Peniarth 50 has attracted considerable comment for its combinative attitude towards Welsh, English and Latin prophetic content.<a title="" name="_ftnref11" >[11]</a> The scribe, Dafydd, who gives his name before the first item in a multilingual prophetic sequence, <em>Darogan Olew Bendigaid</em> (an adaptative translation from the English Latin prophecy ‘Holy Oil of St Thomas’), states that he was encouraged by ‘some mysterious companion’ to translate material from English, Latin and French into Welsh.<a title="" name="_ftnref12" >[12]</a> This field of linguistic interest speaks to the contents of the manuscript as a whole.<a title="" name="_ftnref13" >[13]</a> The second Welsh version is found in <a href="https://viewer.library.wales/4389453#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&xywh=-352%2C-182%2C3494%2C3636">Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS Peniarth 54 i</a>, where it appears alongside Welsh verse prophecy (<em>cwyddau brud</em> ). This version is entitled <em>Y Broffwydoliath Fer </em> (The Small Prophecy), a title which suggests that it was read as a counterpart to the Welsh translation of the <em>Prophetiae Merlini: Y Broffwydoliaeth Fawr </em> (The Great Prophecy) (see <strong><em>Prophecies of Merlin</em> )</strong>.<a title="" name="_ftnref14" >[14]</a> <em>Y </em> <em>Broffwydoliath Fer</em> introduces an additional figure to the order of succession given in the prophecy: a piglet born of the boar of Windsor, who precedes the mole. The piglet appears in Welsh language prophecies, such as the Myrddin poem <em>Yr Oianau </em> (<em>‘</em> The Ohs’), and this inclusion belongs to a distinctly Welsh prophetic context. The Welsh translation and reception history of the <em>Six Kings</em> suggests the naturalisation of the prophecy within a Welsh prophetic context, although it is worth noting that it does not appear to have ever been rendered in <em>cywydd. </em> Allusions from the prophecy do, however, appear in Welsh political poetry from the fourteenth century onwards, including Iolo Goch’s panegyric to Edward III, which lauds Edward as the boar of Windsor; and fifteenth-century Tudor prophecy, such as the <em>cywyddau brud </em> of Dafydd Llwyd, which identity Richard III as the despised mole.<a title="" name="_ftnref15" >[15]</a> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">English Language Composition (/Combining) in Wales</span></strong></p><p>An English language verse adaptation of the <em>Original Prose Version </em> (via two intermediary English verse texts: the <em>English Couplet Version </em> and the <em>First Revised Couplet Version</em> ),<a title="" name="_ftnref16" ><[16]</a> termed the <em>Second Revised Couplet Version,</em> appears in another significant multilingual manuscript containing Yorkist political prophecies, produced in the Welsh March (Oswestry) during the mid-fifteenth century: Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales,, MS Peniarth 26.<a title="" name="_ftnref17" >[17]</a> This variant version is only found in a Welsh context. Alongside Peniarth 26, it survives in Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS Peniarth 94 (compiled c. 1600), the commonplace book of Thomas Wiliems, Caernarfonshire recusant, lexicographer and physician.<a title="" name="_ftnref18" >[18]</a> In Peniarth 94, it appears in a sequence of English language prophecies, in a manuscript which is otherwise in Welsh. The <em>Second Revised Couplet Version</em> is derived from the <em>First Revised Couplet Version, </em> which features in Yorkist manuscripts from England. In both Welsh manuscripts, the <em>Second Revised Couplet Version</em> follows continuously from another prophecy in circulation in both England and Wales in the mid-fifteenth century, concerning British resurgence and Saxon decline, beginning ‘S Mysed’ (<a href="https://www.dimev.net/record.php?recID=4522">DIMEV 4522</a> ). The <em>Second Revised Couplet Version</em> draws on the concluding vision of the tripartite division of Britain (or England) under the lion, wolf and dragon:</p><p> </p><p>[then] the ii bestys schal be fule scharppe<br>to were agayns the moldwarppe<br>Then owt o Ireland schall come a lyon<br>To holde with the wolf and the dragon<br>The moldwerppe fast schall flee<br>Sothen after dye shall hee<br>In the flood of the trebull see<br>(Peniarth 26, p. 116; my transcription)</p><p> </p><p>As in the <em>First Revised Couplet Version,</em> the moldwarp is succeeded not by the three-part rule of the wolf, dragon and lion, but the ass (the fifth king of the original prophecy), which presumably is a reference to legends of the return of Richard II, which appears in English and Welsh prophecies of this period. The interest in this particular passage may owe something to its retrospective association with the anti-Lancastrian alliance between Owain Glyn Dŵr and the Percy family in the early fifteenth century, which culminated in the 1405 Tripartite Indenture, proposing a three-part division of England and an extended, independent, Wales. This is certainly a feature of a number of English prophecies which saw mid-century Welsh reception. Beyond its putative political applications, the production and circulation of the <em>Second Revised Couplet Version</em> is strongly suggestive of English-language verse adaptation in a Welsh or Marcher context, and testifies to the status of English as a literary-political language in Wales by the mid-fifteenth century. </p><p> </p><p>This transmission history might also be contextualised by the circulation of Middle English prose copies of the prophecy contained in the Middle English <em>Brut,</em> in Herefordshire during the fifteenth century, as noted on the database. In addition, the earliest name which appears in Yale, Yale University Library Takamiya MS 12 (which Matheson has suggested is fifteenth-century) is Richard Thomas of Neath (Glamorgan), which appears alongside other names suggestive of the manuscript’s Welsh circulation.<a title="" name="_ftnref19" >[19]</a> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">The Latin Translation</span></strong></p><p>Between 1415 and 1470, an abbreviated adaptative Latin translation of the Anglo-Norman <em>Original Prose Version</em> was produced, which survives in three fifteenth-century, and one seventeenth-century, English manuscripts (the latter is excluded from our database as it is beyond the date range of the current survey).<a title="" name="_ftnref20" >[20]</a> This is an unusual direction of translation, and appears to have been undertaken with a mind to the prophecy’s incorporation in Latin prophecy collections,including prophetic material from Geoffrey of Monmouth’s <em>Historia, </em> the <em>Prophetiae Merlini, </em> and later Latin derivatives. In the case of the Latin translations, language choice appears to have been governed by a sense of linguistic congruity in terms of manuscript context. </p><p> </p><p>The Latin translation saw explicitly Yorkist application, and in Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 623 it appears alongside <a href="https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/Discover/Search/#/?p=c+0,t+,rsrs+0,rsps+10,fa+,so+ox%3Asort%5Easc,scids+,pid+9a17e0fb-c2a0-45e2-8f93-97daba215bb1,vi+b29e7add-3aaa-459d-82cc-64a2b4c3e2c3">diagrams</a> identifying Edward IV with various heroes of Galfridian prophecy, including the boar (aper), and Henry VI with similarly Galfridian terms of antipathy, including the mole (talpa); both figures lifted from the <em>Six Kings. </em> The most significant adaptive detail of the Latin translation is its division of the career of the boar into two parts: the first (containing an account of the boar’s various good qualities) appears as in the original sequence; the second (the boar’s imperial conquests) is included as a coda, after the reign of the moldwarp. This was surely facilitated by the identification of the Lancastrian kings with the moldwarp, and the particular association of Edward IV with the boar – the prophetic meanings of which here conveniently intersect with a heraldic symbol of the house of York. In this new arrangement, the boar appears as both Edward III and Edward IV.</p><p> </p><p>One of the three fifteenth-century manuscripts containing the Latin translation is suggestive of an overt association with the Percy earls of Northumberland, presumably following their allegiance to the house of York in 1469. London, British Library, MS Cotton Vespasian E. vii contains the arms of Henry Percy, 4<sup>th</sup>Earl of Northumberland, and a number of the prophecies in the collection mention ‘luna’, a cipher for the house.<a title="" name="_ftnref21" >[21]</a> Fol. 74r contains a very similar table of positive prophetic ciphers as Bodley 623. The <em>Six Kings </em> may well represent a nodal point between Yorkist and Percy-ite dynastic discourses: figures from the <em>Six Kings </em> (the union of the dragon and the lion) appear to have been understood in relation to the 1405 Tripartite Indenture, as it appears in the Percy-ite prophecy <em>Cock in the North – </em> an English language derivative of the <em>Six Kings,</em> also in Latin translation in Cotton Vespasian E. vii, and similarly circulated as a Yorkist political prophecy in both England and Wales.<a title="" name="_ftnref22" >[22]</a> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></strong></p><p>It is no coincidence that the <em>Six Kings </em> appears in English or Welsh translation in both Peniarth MSS 26 and 50. These two manuscripts are among the earliest trilingual collections in Wales containing English rather than French content alongside Welsh and Latin. The circulation of English-language prophecies in Wales (whether in translation or original) appears to have been intimately connected to the late medieval literary uses of English in Wales, and even – I have elsewhere suggested – played a part in the growth of English as a literary language in Wales.<a title="" name="_ftnref23" >[23]</a> Beyond Wales, the <em>Six Kings </em> presents a significant chapter in a broader history of insular multilingualism. The prophecy’s multilingual reception history speaks to the horizons of expectation associated with particular medieval languages in different spheres across the insular world. During the same period in which the prophecies were adapted in English, as a political language, in Wales (alongside their Welsh translation), they were also translated into Latin in England. This appears to have been undertaken to establish parity with earlier Galfridian prophecies, and this particular language choice suggests a strong perception of source relationships which governed treatment of the text (this is not dissimilar to the alignment of the Peniarth 54 Welsh prose translation with Welsh translations of the <em>Prophetiae Merlini</em> ). Although in this context Latin appears to have been understood as particularly germane to prophetic and imperial imaginings, <p class="p1">its function as an elite language was shared in Wales with Welsh, and potentially English, and we might note that in the context of the <span class="s1"><em>Brut</em></span>, the prophecy found an aristocratic, or even royal, readership in French.</p></p><p> </p><p>The results of this survey are particularly remarkable, however, in the temporal correspondence they suggest between the transmission and translation of English political prophetic content in Wales and in France, for which the strongest hypothesis appears to be (when read alongside a resurgence of partisan English uses of the prophecy) the presence of cross-border networks of Yorkist affiliation and political interest from the mid-fifteenth century onwards. This line of analysis is, however, only one part of the story, and cross-border reception may well have shaped the subsequent development and applications of the English tradition. Certainly, the <em>Second Revised Couplet Version </em> suggests the importance of Wales and the March as a sphere of English language literary activity and innovation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle">EDITIONS</strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Original Prose Version</span></strong></p><p>Taylor, Rupert, <em>Political Prophecy in England </em> (New York: Cornell University Press, 1911), pp.160-64</p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">English Prose Translation</span></strong></p><p>Brie, Friedrich W.

			"significance":'<p>Edward the Confessor (d. 1066) was one of the last Anglo-Saxon kings of England, and he came to be venerated as a royal saint.<a title="" name="_ftnref1" >[1]</a> Edward’s cult was centred on his shrine at Westminster Abbey, which he had refounded, and became particularly associated with the English monarchy, who adopted him as one of their patrons.<a title="" name="_ftnref2" >[2]</a> There is an extensive hagiographical tradition relating to Edward’s cult, but his pivotal role in the history of the Norman Conquest means that accounts of his life are also very widespread in medieval historical writing; the two textual traditions can be distinguished to some degree, but there is also a substantial amount of mutual influence.<a title="" name="_ftnref3" >[3]</a> </p><p> </p><p>This entry deals with vernacular <em>Lives</em> of St Edward produced in England, Iceland and France, all of which are entirely or partly based on the <em>Vita S. Edwardi</em> by Aelred of Rievaulx, composed between 1161 and 1163. This was the third <em>Vita</em> to be written about Edward within the first century after his death. The first, the <em>Vita Ædwardi Regis</em>, was commissioned by Edward’s widow Edith and composed by an anonymous author who was probably a monk of St. Omer.<a title="" name="_ftnref4" >[4]</a> However, the veneration of Edward as a saint is largely a product of the twelfth century, a period which saw the composition of two further <em>vitae</em> . Around 1138 Osbert of Clare, prior of Westminster, wrote another <em>Vita</em>, encouraging a cult which eventually led to Edward’s canonisation in 1161.<a title="" name="_ftnref5" >[5]</a> In 1163 Edward’s relics were translated into a new shrine at Westminster, and it was this occasion for which Aelred composed his <em>Vita</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref6" >[6]</a> </p><p> </p><p>Aelred’s became the most popular of Edward’s <em>vitae</em>, surviving in 29 manuscripts, and it formed the basis for numerous later Latin and vernacular lives of the saint, including those discussed in this entry (manuscripts of Aelred’s <em>Vita</em> itself are not considered here). However, the existence of other <em>vitae</em>, as well as the circulation of information about Edward in different sources and media, including liturgical texts, chronicles, and visual art, frequently complicates the question of textual transmission; in most cases, translators of the texts discussed here had access to other information about Edward in addition to Aelred’s <em>Vita</em> . It is important to note, too, that hagiographical material about Edward also circulated beyond the insular context which is the focus of this entry (for instance, vernacular versions of Edward’s legend are also found in medieval German and Dutch).</p><p> </p><p>This entry discusses the following narratives of Edward’s life in Anglo-Norman, Middle English and Old Norse:</p><p> </p><p>-      <em>La Vie d\'Edouard le Confesseur</em> (Anglo-Norman verse, c. 1163-70)</p><p>-      <em>De saint Edouart</em> (Anglo-Norman prose, c. 1300-25)</p><p>-      <em>La Estoire de Seint Aedward le Rei</em> (Anglo-Norman verse, c. 1236-45)</p><p>-      <em>Life of Edward the Confessor</em> (Middle English verse, c.1300)</p><p>-      <em>Life of Edward the Confessor</em> (Middle English prose, 15<sup>th</sup>century)</p><p>-      <em>Life of Edward the Confessor</em> (Middle English prose, 15<sup>th</sup>century)</p><p>-      <em>Játvarðar saga </em> (Old Norse prose, 14<sup>th</sup>century)</p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Anglo-Norman Versions</span></strong></p><p>Within a few years of the 1163 translation of Edward’s relics, a nun of Barking Abbey in Essex composed an Anglo-Norman verse life of the saint, <em>La Vie d’Edouard le Confesseur</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref7" >[7]</a> The author is anonymous, but her translation of a Latin text into Anglo-Norman hagiography is paralleled by other contemporary examples from Barking Abbey, which in this period was a notable centre for women’s writing and scholarship.<a title="" name="_ftnref8" >[8]</a> The <em>Vie</em> is based on Aelred’s <em>Vita</em>, but with adaptations and additions throughout, among which Jane Bliss notes an enhanced role for the female characters.<a title="" name="_ftnref9" >[9]</a> </p><p> </p><p>The <em>Vie</em> survives in three manuscripts of the late thirteenth century, in each of which it is incomplete.<a title="" name="_ftnref10" >[10]</a> One of these (<a href="https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Reg.lat.489">Rome, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, MS Reg. Lat. 489</a>) may be from Barking, and also contains a Latin verse life based on Aelred’s <em>Vita</em>. The portion of the text in this manuscript comprises lines 1463-6885 of the <em>Vie</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref11" >[11]</a> Another fragment, as far as line 4240, appears among a collection of Anglo-Norman saints’ lives from the priory of Campsey Ash in Suffolk (<a href="http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=7165">London, British Library, MS Additional 70513</a>).<a title="" name="_ftnref12" >[12]</a> This manuscript, which was used for refectory reading by the canonesses at Campsey, contains a number of lives by female authors, and provides important evidence for literary composition and readership by communities of elite women in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.<a title="" name="_ftnref13" >[13]</a> The third witness to the <em>Vie</em> comes from outside England: a portion of the text (lines c. 69-4482) was incorporated into Wace’s <em>Roman de Brut</em> in a manuscript made in Picardy in c.1292 (<a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9059827w.r=1416%201416?rk=21459;2"><span class="s1">Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que nationale de France, MS f. fr. 1416</span></a>).<a title="" name="_ftnref14" >[14]</a> </p><p> </p><p>In addition, in the first half of the fourteenth century the <em>Vie</em> was reworked into a version in French prose, which provides the only surviving witness to the complete narrative of the Barking <em>Vie</em> . This prose version, <em>De saint Edouart</em>, appears among a collection of religious works in a richly illustrated manuscript (<a href="http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Egerton_MS_745">London, British Library, MS Egerton 745</a>), which was made for the de Châtillon family, counts of St Pol near Amiens.<a title="" name="_ftnref15" >[15]</a> </p><p>Independent of this group of texts is another life of Edward in Anglo-Norman verse, <em>La Estoire de Seint Aedward le Rei</em> . The <em>Estoire</em> was composed in c.1236-1245, probably by Matthew Paris, monk of St Albans,<a title="" name="_ftnref16" >[16]</a> and is associated with an increase in royal patronage of Edward’s cult in the reign of Henry III (1216-72). Henry took a particular interest in Edward, supporting the rebuilding of Westminster Abbey, which he chose as the location of his own burial, and naming his eldest son after the saint.<a title="" name="_ftnref17" >[17]</a> The <em>Estoire</em> is dedicated to Queen Eleanor of Provence, Henry’s wife, and can be dated to the period between Eleanor’s marriage to Henry in 1236 and the start of rebuilding work at Westminster in 1245. The narrative is based on Aelred’s <em>Vita</em>, supplemented by information from Matthew Paris’ other historical writings. The sole surviving manuscript(<a href="http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-EE-00003-00059/11"><span class="s1">Cambridge, Cambridge University Library, MS Ee.3.59</span></a>), which contains only this text, is a slightly later copy from London or Westminster, possibly made around 1255 for the use of Eleanor and Henry’s daughter-in-law Queen Eleanor of Castile, wife of Edward I. It appears to be one of the books recorded as being rebound for the queen in 1288.The manuscript is extensively illustrated with scenes from the text, andhas been described as ‘a masterpiece of mid thirteenth-century English illumination’; bothscript and illustrations display similarities with other manuscripts produced at London and Westminster in this period and with wall-paintings made in the 1250s at Windsor Castle.<a title="" name="_ftnref18" >[18]</a> </p><p> </p><p>The Anglo-Norman versions of Edward’s <em>Life</em>, then, all bear witness to royal and aristocratic interest in Edward’s cult in England and France, beginning in the years after the 1163 translation and continuing into the fourteenth century. The Barking nun’s <em>Vie d’Edouard</em>, with its connections to Barking Abbey and Campsey, is testimony to the overlap of interests between court circles and religious communities made up of learned aristocratic women; in that light, it seems notable that Matthew Paris’ <em>Estoire</em> is also closely linked with the patronage of two royal queens.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Middle English Versions</span></strong></p><p>Middle English versions of Edward’s <em>Life</em> are relatively few in number, consisting of one verse and two prose lives. As Cynthia Turner Camp has noted, this paucity of vernacular written material is a striking contrast to the numerous commemorations of Edward in medieval English art,<a title="" name="_ftnref19" >[19]</a> and it seems to be indicative of the restricted social and geographical spread of Edward’s cult within England.</p><p> </p><p>The earliest English version of Edward’s <em>Life</em> appears as an addition to the <em>South English Legendary</em> collection of saints’ lives.<a title="" name="_ftnref20" >[20]</a> The <em>South English Legendary</em> was the most popular legendary collection in Middle English by far, surviving in more than 60 manuscripts produced between the late thirteenth and fifteenth centuries.<a title="" name="_ftnref21" >[21]</a> Edward the Confessor features in only three manuscripts of the <em>South English Legendary</em>, surprisingly few given the prominence the collection affords to pre-Conquest English saints in general (compare, for instance, the numbers of known manuscripts for other Anglo-Saxon saints’ lives included in the collection: 19 for Edward the Martyr, 21 for St Cuthbert, 23 for St Dunstan). The first copy of the <em>Legendary</em> to incorporate Edward’s life is Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Ashmole 43, which dates from c.1300-1330 and has been localised to Gloucestershire. This manuscript contains over 90 individual saints’ lives, of which the <em>Life of St Edward</em> is the last; as a result of damage to the manuscript, the closing leaves of the <em>Life of St Edward</em> are in a fragmentary state and some leaves have been lost.<a title="" name="_ftnref22" >[22]</a> The English <em>Life</em> is ultimately derived from Aelred’s <em>Vita</em>, but it is possible that the author may have used an Anglo-Norman translation as his immediate source.</p><p> </p><p>There are also two fifteenth-century manuscripts of this <em>Life</em>, in London, British Library, MS Cotton Julius D. IX’ and ‘Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 779 (SC 2567), both of which are versions of the <em>South English Legendary</em> collection. Cotton Julius D IX contains the most complete text of the three manuscripts, while the Bodley manuscript has been abbreviated by the omission of various incidents from Edward’s life, so that it is approximately half the length of the other two witnesses.<a title="" name="_ftnref23" >[23]</a> </p><p>Two further prose lives of St Edward, which seem to be independent of each other, survive in fifteenth-century manuscripts.<a title="" name="_ftnref24" >[24]</a> One of these, London, British Library, MS Additional 35298, contains the fullest Middle English version of Jacobus de Voragine’s compilation of saints’ lives, the <em>Legenda Aurea</em>, called in English the <em>Gilte Legende</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref25" >[25]</a> This is the only manuscript of that collection in which Edward’s <em>Life</em> appears. The manuscript seems to be from London or Westminster, and a closely related version was used by William Caxton for his edition of the <em>Golden Legend</em>, published at Westminster in c.1483-4.<a title="" name="_ftnref26" >[26]</a> The second prose life is found in Oxford, Trinity College, MS 11, which contains only this text; this appears to be a prose reworking of the <em>South English Legendary</em> verse life, rather than a new translation from the Latin.<a title="" name="_ftnref27" >[27]</a> </p><p> </p><p>Altogether, the limited number of English <em>Lives</em> of Edward is indicative of the status and distribution of Edward’s cult in later medieval England. Edward’s cult enjoyed elite patronage at Westminster Abbey, particularly from the royal family, and this ensured a continuing interest in his cult there into the late fifteenth century. Beyond this, however, the appearance of his <em>Life</em> in such a small number of manuscripts within the very popular <em>South English Legendary</em> tradition, as well as the limited number of other vernacular lives, supports the impression that his cult never achieved widespread popularity in England.</p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Old Norse Versions</span></strong></p><p>The overlap between historical and hagiographical narratives dealing with Edward the Confessor is well illustrated by the Old Norse saga about the saint, <em>Játvarðar saga</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref28" >[28]</a> This is a prose account of Edward’s life written in Iceland in the fourteenth century, drawing on a range of hagiographical and other sources. The saga uses episodes from the <em>vitae</em> of both Osbert of Clare and Aelred of Rievaulx, and it is likely that the translator encountered these in excerpted form, in books for use in the liturgy, and then shaped them into a fuller narrative of the saint’s life.There are records of English lectionaries and sanctorales in Icelandic church libraries, and books of this kind might have provided the chief source for <em>Játvarðar saga</em>, as for other Old Norse sagas which relate the stories of English saints.<a title="" name="_ftnref29" >[29]</a> </p><p> </p><p>As well as these hagiographical sources, however, the saga also draws on other material relating to events in England before and after the Norman Conquest. It is perhaps best known for an episode which does not come from Edward’s hagiography, telling how after the Conquest a group of surviving Englishmen emigrated to Byzantium and established a colony there. This information has parallels in the <em>Chronicon universale anonymi Laudunensis</em>, a chronicle surviving in two thirteenth-century manuscripts, which was written by an English monk living at Laon.<a title="" name="_ftnref30" >[30]</a> The saga further relates how Harold Godwinson survived the Battle of Hastings, a story which it attributes to (unnamed) English sources. Additionally, the adaptor made use of information from Old Norse kings’ sagas, particularly <em>Haralds saga Sigurðarsonar</em>, and it was doubtless part of the story’s appeal to the translator that a number of eleventh-century kings of Denmark and Norway feature in the narrative of Edward’s life. The text shares a number of generic features and thematic concerns with the kings’ sagas, assimilating the English source material into an established genre of Old Norse prose writing.</p><p> </p><p><em>Játvarðar saga </em> survives in thirteen manuscripts from Iceland, of which only the three pre-1550 manuscripts are included in this database.<a title="" name="_ftnref31" >[31]</a> It appears in <em>Flateyjarbók</em> (Reykjavík, Arnamagnæan Institute, GkS 1005 fol.), one of the most important manuscripts from medieval Iceland, which contains an extensive compilation of kings’ sagas, romances, saints’ lives, and much other material.<em>Flateyjarbók</em> was written between 1387-95, commissioned by Jon Hákonarson, possibly as a gift for the king of Norway.<a title="" name="_ftnref32" >[32]</a> <em>Játvarðar saga </em> also appears in aslightly earlier fourteenth-century manuscript (Stockholm, National Library of Sweden, Perg. fol. no. 5), from the monastery at Þykkvibær, Iceland, which contains mostly bishops’ sagas;<a title="" name="_ftnref33" >[33]</a> a fragment of a further manuscript of the saga survivesfrom the second half of the fifteenth century (Copenhagen, Arnamagnæan Institute, AM 238 fol. XVI).</p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></strong></p><p>The textual history of the Anglo-Norman and Middle English <em>Lives</em> illustrates some of the characteristic features of Edward the Confessor’s cult, especially the importance of elite patronage in the promotion of the cult in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and the concentration of interest in Edward near his shrine at Westminster. While the Middle English <em>Lives</em> play only a minor part in the vibrant culture of medieval vernacular hagiography, the Anglo-Norman <em>Lives</em> are of much greater interest, in particular the <em>Vie</em> of the nun of Barking, one of the earliest works from England known to be by a woman, and testimony to the significant role played by female authors, readers and patrons in the multilingual literary culture of twelfth-century England.</p><p> </p><p>The transmission of Edward’s <em>Life</em> to Iceland has a different kind of significance, as a product of the long-standing relationship between the English and Scandinavian churches which was established in the Anglo-Saxon period and continued throughout the Middle Ages. None of the versions of the <em>Life</em> considered here is a straightforward translation – all rework and adapt their sources – but <em>Játvarðar saga</em> is perhaps the best example of the creative nature of medieval translation practice and the productive mutability of hagiography as a genre. The <em>Life</em> of Edward the Confessor, a narrative which inescapably blurs the line between hagiography and history-writing, offered a means of exploring not only the life-story of an individual saint, but also its implications for the shared history of England, Normandy, and Scandinavia.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle">EDITIONS</strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Latin  Original</span></strong></p><p>Aelred of Rievaulx, <em>Vita S.

			"significance": '<p class="Standard"><em>Fierabras</em> is best known in its <em>chanson de geste</em> form which survives today in about a dozen medieval manuscripts.<a title="" name="_ftnref1" >[1]</a> The text relates the efforts of Charlemagne and his vassals to recover relics of the passion stolen from Rome by the saracen king, Balan. The eponymous Fierabras is the son of Balan and stands fifteen feet tall. He enters into single combat with Oliver and is defeated, but subsequently converts to Christianity. The text’s focus on the relics of the passion was, no doubt, one of the sources of its popularity, but it also offers the typical<em>chanson de geste </em> diet of numerous, loosely linked adventures, as well as a love story between the <em>belle sarrasine</em>, Floripas (Fierabras’ sister), and Gui de Bourgogne. The work’s popularity was considerable and it was adapted into Occitan and from that language into Italian. However, the work seems to have enjoyed particular popularity in England and Ireland, albeit late in the Middle Ages. </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p>Insular versions of this text were produced in four languages: Anglo-Norman, Middle English, Latin and Early Modern Irish. The source of all these versions, except that in Irish, was a French-language work. The Irish text was produced from a Latin translation of the French <em>chanson de geste</em> which was probably made in Ireland. It is clear that this and other <em>chansons de geste</em> also circulated in continental French copies in England and references to the work in texts like Barbour’s<em>Bruce</em> suggest that it was well known.<a title="" name="_ftnref2" >[2]</a> As late as the fifteenth century, a prose version of the work was among the texts presented to Margaret of Anjou in the lavish <a href="http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=18385">Talbot-Shrewsbury Book</a> (London, British Library, MS Royal 15 E. vi).</p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">This entry discusses the following versions of <em>Fierabras</em> from the insular tradition:</p><p class="Standard">-       <em>Fierabras</em>, ‘vulgate’ version (Anglo-Norman verse, c. 1200)</p><p class="Standard">-       <em>Fierabras</em>, ‘version courte’ (Anglo-Norman verse, c. 1300)</p><p class="Standard">-       <em>Sir Ferumbras</em> (Middle English verse, late fourteenth century)</p><p class="Standard">-       <em>Firumbras</em> (Middle English verse, late fourteenth century)</p><p class="Standard">-       <em>The Sowdowne of Babylone</em> (Middle English verse, late fourteenth or early fifteenth century)</p><p class="Standard">-       <em>Charles the Grete</em> (Middle English prose, 1485)</p><p class="Standard">-       <em>Gesta Karoli Magni</em> (Latin prose, fifteenth century)</p><p class="Standard">-       <em>Stair Fortibrais</em> (Early Modern Irish prose, fifteenth century)</p><p class="Standard"><strong> </strong></p><p class="Standard"><strong><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Anglo-Norman versions</span></strong></p><p>There are two versions of <em>Fierabras </em> in Anglo-Norman, what is known as the ‘vulgate’ or ‘version longe’ (dating from around 1200) and the ‘version courte’ (dating from around 1300).<a title="" name="_ftnref3" >[3]</a> The ‘vulgate’ version survives in both Anglo-Norman and continental French copies, while the ‘version courte’ seems to be a distinctively insular abbreviation of the narrative. <em>Fierabras </em> is closely associated with another Anglo-Norman work, <em>La Destruction de Rome</em> which offers a prelude to its events. <em>La Destruction</em> is collected with <em>Fierabras</em> in two of the three of the Anglo-Norman manuscripts of the narrative. The two texts are also integrated in the Middle English tradition. </p><p> </p><p>The earliest manuscript, Leuven, Univ. Bibl., MS G.170, ff. 53-130 (the Firmin Didot MS), dated from the second half of the thirteenth century and was destroyed during the Second World War. In this codex, the incomplete text of <em>Fierabras</em> followed a text of another much-translated work, <em>Boeve de Haumtone</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref4" >[4]</a> The two texts have certain narrative similarities, including the motif of the <em>belle sarrasine</em> . The other surviving Anglo-Norman manuscript of the vulgate version is Hanover, Niedersächsische Landesbibliothek, MS IV 578 which dates from the early fourteenth century.<a title="" name="_ftnref5" >[5]</a> This is a composite manuscript and includes a slightly earlier text of <em>La Destruction de Rome</em> in a different scribal hand.<a title="" name="_ftnref6" >[6]</a> However, the two works must have been bound together early in their history, since a coherent set of medieval illustrations runs through the whole codex.<a title="" name="_ftnref7" >[7]</a> The ‘version courte’ text that survives in London, British Library, MS Egerton 3028 is also preceded by <em>La Destruction de Rome</em> . This codex dates from the second quarter of the fourteenth century and features a large number of coloured pen illustrations of early date and similar to the illustrations in the Hanover manuscript.<a title="" name="_ftnref8" >[8]</a> </p><p> </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><strong><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Middle English versions</span></strong></p><p class="Standard">Middle English translations were produced of both the ‘vulgate’ and ‘version courte’ texts of <em>Fierabras</em> . Two apparently independent translations were made of the ‘vulgate’ text in the late fourteenth century. <em>Sir Ferumbras</em> survives in Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Ashmole 33 and is the sole text in the manuscript.<a title="" name="_ftnref9" >[9]</a> This is a verse adaptation and is usually dated to the late fourteenth century. A draft copy of the work also survives in the binding of Ashmole 33.<a title="" name="_ftnref10" >[10]</a>  This has been written on the back of documents relating to the dioceses of Exeter and Sherboune which bear the dates 1357 and 1377. The latter year represents a <em>terminus a quo</em> for the draft and the contents of the document suggest that the translation may have been produced in an ecclesiastical milieu. The other English adaptation of the ‘vulgate’ version, <em>Sir Firumbras,</em> survives in an incomplete copy in the Fillingham manuscript (London, British Library, MS Additional 37492).<a title="" name="_ftnref11" >[11]</a> Again, the pious dimension of the text is front and centre: this version of <em>Fierabras </em> ends by promising a hundred days indulgence to the attentive listener.<a title="" name="_ftnref12" ><sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></a> The Fillingham manuscript also includes a copy of another Middle English Charlemagne romance, <em>Otuel and Roland</em> . </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">The other Middle English adaptations are from the fifteenth century. The <em>Sowdone of Babylone</em> survives uniquely in <a href="http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/mss/ME/Garrett_MS_140_OPT.pdf">Princeton, University Library, MS Garrett 140</a>, a manuscript which dates from around 1450.<a title="" name="_ftnref13" ><sup><sup>[13]</sup></sup></a> This work is translated from Anglo-Norman ‘version courte’ of <em>Fierabras</em> and combines the work with a translation of<em>La Destruction de Rome</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref14" >[14]</a> This work is closely related to the versions of the Anglo-Norman <em>Fierabras</em> and <em>La Destruction de Rome</em> found in Egerton 3028. </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><em>Fierabras</em> was also printed in English at an early point. William Caxton’s <em>Charles the Grete</em> (STC 5013 / USTC 500110) is a prose translation of Jean Baignon’s French prose, <em>Rommant de Fierabras le geant</em> (1470s) printed at Westminster in December 1485.<a title="" name="_ftnref15" >[15]</a> Baignon’s central source for this work is the story of <em>Fierabras</em>, with further historical material primarily derived from the <em>Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle</em> (possibly via <em>Speculum Historiale</em> of Vincent de Beauvais) framing the text. </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"><strong><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Latin version</span></strong></p><p class="Standard">A Latin prose translation of the <em>chanson de geste</em> version of <em>Fierabras</em> survives in an Irish manuscript, Dublin, Trinity College, MS 667.<a title="" name="_ftnref16" >[16]</a>   Translation from French to Latin is not common and this appears to be the only Latin version of <em>Fierabras</em> in existence. The manuscript was probably compiled in the middle of the fifteenth century and has been associated with the Franciscans.<a title="" name="_ftnref17" >[17]</a> A high proportion of the items in the book are <em>exempla </em> and commonplaces.<a title="" name="_ftnref18" >[18]</a> Short notes on the nature of preachers (p. 82) and on masters and students (p. 146) suggest that this manuscript (or parts of it) might have played some part in the formation of novices.<a title="" name="_ftnref19" >[19]</a> There are also various sermons, canon law notes and texts reflecting Irish interests, such extracts from Gerald of Wales’ writings on Ireland. The manuscript features another lengthy text about Charlemagne, the <em>Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle</em> . Among the manuscript’s other more substantial contents, are Honorius Augustodunensis’s <em>Elucidarium</em>, the <em>Historia Septem Sapientum</em>, <em>Visio Sancti Pauli</em>, <em>De Spiritu Guidonis</em>, the <em>Meditationes</em> of Pseudo-Bernard and Étienne de Bourbon’s account of Robert the Devil. A particularly high number of the texts in this manuscript appear in Irish translation in other codices of the period, including <a href="https://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?https://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/english/ria_menu.html" target="_blank">Dublin, Royal Irish Academy, MS 23 O 48</a> (Liber Flavus Fergusiorum), <a href="https://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?https://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/english/ria_menu.html" target="_blank">Dublin, Royal Irish Academy MS 24 P 25</a> (Leabhar Chlainne Suibhne), London, British Library, MS Egerton 1781 and <a href="https://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?https://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/KINGS/english/index.html" target="_blank"> Dublin, King’s Inns, MS 10</a>.<a title="" name="_ftnref20" >[20]</a> </p><p class="Standard"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p><p class="Standard"><strong><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Early Modern Irish version</span></strong></p><p class="Standard">A version of this Latin text seems to have been the exemplar for the Irish translation of <em>Fierabras</em>, <em>Stair Fortibrais</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref21" >[21]</a> This text has a prologue recounting the finding of the true cross and passion relics.

In his analysis of the most typical strategies of adaptation adopted by the Latin translator, Michael Howard Davies observes that the translator tends to eschew lengthy description and to shorten speeches, and that his approach to his materials seems intended to produce ‘a text that read like a history, not like an epic poem’.<a title="" name="_ftnref23" ><sup><sup>[23]</sup></sup></a> </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard">The eight surviving Irish manuscripts of <em>Stair Fortibrais</em> suggest considerable popularity in a context where most medieval translations only survive in unique copies. The surviving manuscripts of the Irish translation come from all over the island and, where owners can be identified, from both Hiberno-Norman and Gaelic households. Egerton 1781 is associated with the Mac Parrthaláin family of scribes. The text of <em>Fierabras</em> is in the hand of an unnamed scribe, who states he is working for Niall Ó Siaghail in Co. Offaly in 1484.<a title="" name="_ftnref24" >[24]</a>   <a href="https://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?https://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/english/ria_menu.html"><em>Leabhar Chlainne Suibhne</em> </a> comes to us with the most context and perhaps gives a good indication of the sort of reader for whom manuscripts like these were assembled.<a title="" name="_ftnref25" >[25]</a> It was written in 1513-14 for Máire, wife of Mac Suibhne Fanad, by a scribe working on Tory Island, Co. Donegal. The other contents of the manuscript are generally of a pious sort, including saints’ lives and devotional works. Many are translations from Latin. <a href="https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/Discover/Search/#/?p=c+0,t+,rsrs+0,rsps+10,fa+,so+ox%3Asort%5Easc,scids+,pid+cb909a51-5acd-4fee-95ec-51ff09b87676,vi+f14978b7-527a-4e9b-9e86-99b5a5037b5f" target="_blank">Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Laud Misc. 610</a> is a composite manuscript, made up of two books compiled for a Hiberno-Norman family, the Butlers of Ormond. The other contents of the section in which <em>Stair Fortibrais</em> appears are largely devotional in tone, with some genealogical and legendary material. The Butlers have been associated with Dublin, Trinity College MS 1298 too, though it is also possible that its patrons were a minor branch of the Fitzgerald family, the Fitzgeralds of Allen.<a title="" name="_ftnref26" >[26]</a> Translated works are particularly numerous in this manuscript and the translation of <em>Fierabras </em> is included in a section of the codex that also features an Irish translation of Lucan’s <em>Pharsalia</em> and a unique translation of the Hiberno-English version of Gerald of Wales’ <em>Expugnatio Hibernica</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref27" >[27]</a> The Irish translation of <em>Bevis of Hampton</em> appears in the second part of the codex, which also seems to have been in the hands of the Fitzgeralds of Allen at an early point.</p><p class="Standard">In three of the surviving manuscripts, Egerton 1781, King’s Inns 10 and Dublin, Trinity College, MS 1304, a translation of the <em>Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle</em>,<em>Gabháltais Shearluis Mhóir</em>,follows immediately after that of <em>Sdair Fortibrais</em> .The connection between these two texts is structurally looser than that between <em>Sdair Fortibrais</em> and the translation of <em>De Inventione Sanctae Crucis</em>, but it is persistent enough to suggest conscious attempts to associate the text by scribes.</p><p class="Standard"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p><p class="Standard"><strong><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></strong></p><p class="Standard">The textual history of <em>Fierabras</em> in the insular world suggests that its popularity was limited to England and Ireland, but that it was well known and widely circulated in translation in both those regions. The work was not only translated often, but heavily adapted in some versions and associated with other texts of the Matter of France. If the sorts of changes made in translation and the manuscript contexts in which the work survives are anything to go by, audiences seem to have been attracted to the work as much for its pious dimension as for its emphasis on adventure. </p><p> </p><p>The surviving insular adaptations witness a tendency to combine the narrative with other material relating to Charlemagne and the passion relics. This sort of aggregation or ‘cyclification’ of the texts of the Matter of France is quite common, but <em>Fierabras</em> is not a regular element in continental cycles of this kind before the fifteenth century, when David Aubert and Jean Baignon incorporated the story into their Charlemagne histories.<a title="" name="_ftnref28" >[28]</a> It is interesting, therefore, that the fifteenth century insular manuscripts from England and Ireland tend to combine or collect <em>Fierabras</em> with other related works.</p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><strong class="subtitle">EDITIONS</strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Old French version</span></strong></p><p>Le Person, Marc, ed., <em>Fierabras: Chanson de geste du XIIe siècle</em> (Paris: Champion, 2003)</p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Anglo-Norman ‘vulgate’ version</span></strong></p><p>Hilka, Alfons, and André de Mandach, eds., <em>Chanson de Fierabras</em> (Neuchâtel: Pré-publication de Neuchâtel, 1981)</p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Anglo-Norman ‘version courte’</span></strong></p><p>Brandin, L., ‘La Destruction de Rome et Fierabras, MS Egerton 3028 de Musée Britannique’, <em>Romania</em> 64 (1938), 18-100</p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">English versions</span></strong></p><p class="Footnote">Hausknecht, Emil, ed., <em>The English Charlemagne Romances, Part V: The Sowdone of Babylone</em>, EETS ES 38 (London: Trübner, 1881)</p><p class="Footnote"> </p><p class="Footnote">Herrtage, Sidney J.

			"significance": '<p>The transmission and translation history of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s <em>Prophetiae Merlini </em> (Prophecies of Merlin) is closely related to that of Geoffrey’s <em>Historia regum Britanniae </em> (History of the Kings of Britain) (c. 1135-38), in which it appears as Book VII. The <em>Historia </em> is undoubtedly among the most far-reaching, and much translated, texts of the European Middle Ages. <em>Crossing Borders</em> traces four translation movements of the <em>Prophetiae – </em> both in conjunction with, and independent of, the vernacular <em>Brut </em> tradition (translations of the <em>Historia</em> ). It excludes the cross-border movements of the <em>Prophetiae </em> in Latin (the manuscripts of which have been catalogued, although by no means exhaustively), focusing instead on its vernacular reception.<a title="" name="_ftnref1" >[1]</a> These comprise four discrete linguistic movements, given here in chronological order:</p><p> </p><p>1. Anglo-Norman and Middle French (with its origins in the late twelfth-century, and a relatively extensive fifteenth-century continental translation movement)</p><p>2. Old Norse-Icelandic (c. 1200)</p><p>3. Middle Welsh & Early Modern Welsh (c. 1250, with continuous circulation into the sixteenth century)</p><p>4. Middle English (c. 1450-75)</p><p> </p><p>Given the complexity of this material, and its relationship to multiple Brut traditions, the Crossing Borders database is not exhaustive. Areas for further research are outlined in the conclusion.</p><p> </p><p>The <em>Prophetiae</em> have a close relationship to the cross-border movement of literary material from their very inception. As I have written elsewhere, the <em>Prophetiae </em> represents a borrowing of Welsh prophetic models, remediated with Anglo (or rather, Norman)-centric political interests in mind.<a title="" name="_ftnref2" >[2]</a> As such, the <em>Prophetiae </em> retained a significant cultural, and on occasion oppositional, utility within Wales; and exercised similar potential in France during the Hundred Years War. However, much of their appeal appears to have been consistently historiographic, and we see the transmission of the <em>Prophetiae </em> outside a political sphere engaged with British/English affairs in Iceland/Norway. </p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Anglo-Norman & Continental French Translations</span></strong></p><p>The earliest Anglo-Norman translations of the <em>Prophetiae </em> appear as interpolations in Wace’s <em>Roman de Brut </em> (c. 1155), the Anglo-Norman translation of Geoffrey’s <em>Historia </em> which famously omitted the <em>Prophetiae</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref3" >[3]</a> This began in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, during which period the <em>Prophetiae </em> also appears in Anglo-Norman as an independent text, and as a component of anonymous <em>Bruts. </em> </p><p> </p><p>The continental French translations of Geoffrey’s <em>Historia, </em> including the <em>Prophetiae, </em> similarly are related to Wace<em>.</em> <a title="" name="_ftnref4" >[4]</a> They are as follows:</p><p> </p><p>1. <em>Estoire des Bretons</em>, a twelfth-century anonymous prose translation with commentary which survives only in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS français 1717.</p><p> </p><p>2. A late fourteenth or early fifteenth-century anonymous prose translation, <em>Le</em> s <em>Croniques des Bretons. </em> As found in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS français 2806 the text engages in its earlier passages with familiar insular (English) historiographical interpretations (largely in line with those events detailed in the <em>Historia</em> ), but in its later passages is representative of a significant departure from the English historiographical tradition, and engages explicitly with a French political context. The manuscript was in sixteenth-century French royal circulation, and is suggestive of the earlier uses of material from the <em>Prophetiae </em> in French courtly culture. A historical reference in the commentary to the defeat of the French at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 (as a near historical, although not witness account), suggests a date of textual composition in the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century.<a title="" name="_ftnref5" >[5]</a> </p><p> </p><p>3. Jean Wauquelin’s mid-fifteenth-century <em> Roman de Brut. </em> Wauquelin was a clerk of the Dukes of Burgundy, and Bruxelles, Bibliothèque royale de Belgique MS 10415 appears in 1469 and 1485-87 in the library inventory for the Dukes of Burgundy. The version found in London, British Library, MS Lansdowne 214 states that the translation was undertaken for Monsieur de Croy, generally assumed to be Jean de Croy, Captain-General of Hainault. This material, as we might expect, is more closely aligned with the English historiographical tradition.</p><p> </p><p>All three of these translations contain a common debt to Wace, although were independently produced. Translations 2 and 3 exemplify the shifting uses of the <em>Prophetiae </em> in line with continental political divisions during the fifteenth century, when the <em>Prophetiae </em> appear to have seen particular continental purchase. From this period we might also note the appearance of the <em>Prophetiae </em> in the <em>Recueil des croniques</em> of Jehan de Wavrin, produced in Flanders. The full relationship of the continental French translation and transmission history of the <em>Prophetiae</em> to literary production in Flanders is beyond the immediate scope of the <em>Crossing Borders </em> pilot, but two manuscripts have been selected for the database, in respect of their connection to insular political figures. London, British Library, MS Royal 15.E.IV is dedicated to Edward IV, and Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS 74-86 was owned by Louis de Gruuthuse, Edward IV’s Duke of Winchester. (For further discussion of the Louis’s patronage of insular historiographical material, see <strong><em>Prophecy of the Six Kings</em>)</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, we note the inclusion of the <em>Prophetiae </em> in the Vulgate <em>Merlin </em> as it appears in the Didot-<em>Perceval</em> manuscript (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS Nouv. Acq. Fr. 4166).<a title="" name="_ftnref6" >[6]</a> This is the only version of the romance of <em>Merlin</em> (in either French or English) in which the <em>Prophetiae </em> are included. Julian Abed has argued that this version of the <em>Prophetiae, </em> which contains a number of mis-readings of the Latin source and some significant interpolations, was produced in an insular context (although it might similarly be located in the northern French sphere of Plantagenet influence). In its account of the victory of three leopards over a lion, interpolated immediately prior to the prophecy of the anti-English union of <em>Prophetiae</em> 110-14, this variant appears to refer to the English king’s conquests in Scotland (particularly topical c. 1301), in a similar mode to the roughly contemporary Merlinian prophecies of the <em>Chronicle</em> of Pierre de Langtoft. Abed has also suggested that the nature of some of the corruptions of, and substitutions in, the Latin suggest that the author has misread an intermediary French translation. The precise nature of this is uncertain, but it has been suggested that the text might stand in a relationship to the late fifteenth-century Spanish <em>El Baladro del Sabio Merlin </em> (1498), which is the only other version of the Grail legend to interpolate the <em>Prophetiae,</em> and with which it shares some interpolated details with the Didot-<em>Perceval</em> . This transmission history remains a significant unknown, but there may be a French source relationship in common (whether insular or continental, we cannot say). </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Old Norse-Icelandic Adaptive Translation</span></strong></p><p>The Old-Norse Icelandic translation of the <em>Prophetiae, Merlínússpá</em>, is generally dated c. 1200, along with the translation of the <em>Historia,</em> <em>Breta sögur </em> (Stories of the Britons), in which it appears; and is understood to be the work of the translator  Gunnlaugr Leifsson, a monk and author of kings’ sagas at Þingeyrar in northern Iceland.<a title="" name="_ftnref7" >[7]</a> </p><p> </p><p>The only surviving copy is the fourteenth-century <a href="https://www.e-pages.dk/ku/635/">Copenhagen, Arnamagnæan Institute, AM 573to (Hauksbók)</a>, which also contains <em>Trójumanna saga</em> (a translation of Dares Phrygius’s <em>De Excidio</em> <em>Troiae Historia</em> ), longer version of <em>Breta sögur, Valvens Þáttr </em> (Tale of Gawain), a partial translation of <em>Percival</em>, and encyclopedic material. Hauksbók (Book of Haukr) also contains the prophetic<em>Völupsá</em>, an eddic poem in the same meter as <em>Merlínússpá</em> . Although produced by several scribes, the main part of the manuscript is in the hand of Icelander Hauki Erlendsson, and is understood to have been produced in Norway. The prophecy appears divided into two parts – the first drawn from the second half of the poem; the second from the first. It is a relatively close translation of the Latin, combined with literary allusions specific to Norse mythology and history. The text contains four introductory stanzas about the author; and ends with comments on the Christian interpretation of prophecy.</p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Welsh Translations</span></strong></p><p>The earliest translations of the <em>Prophetiae </em> in Wales were probably in the context of the Welsh translations of the <em>Historia</em> : the <em>Brutiau, </em> of which the thirteenth-century <em>Brut Dingestow </em> (Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS 5266) is the earliest known copy.<a title="" name="_ftnref8" >[8]</a> However, there is also a thirteenth-century independent Welsh translation of the <em>Prophetiae </em> in <a href="https://viewer.library.wales/4533649#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&xywh=-292%2C-172%2C3303%2C3437">Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, Peniarth MS 16</a>, which incorporates and translates the commentary of its Latin source.<a title="" name="_ftnref9" >[9]</a> </p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p><p>Translations of the <em>Prophetiae</em> are consistently in prose, and there is no evidence of attempts at versification. This is presumably because the <em>Prophetiae</em> were closely associated with a prose chronicle tradition, although additionally, medieval prophecies translated into Welsh are generally given in prose as opposed to the poetic forms of native prophecy. However, the <em>Prophetiae,</em> which appear as a naturalised component of the Welsh historiographical tradition, are referred to in <em>cywyddau brud </em> (prophetic poetry) of the fifteenth century as <em>Proffwydoliaeth</em> <em>Vawr</em> (The Great Prophecy), which is alluded to as the title of the <em>Prophetiae </em> in the seventeenth-century Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS 3041 (Mostyn 133).<a title="" name="_ftnref10" >[10]</a> This appears to have been understood as a counterpart to <em>Proffwydoliaeth</em> <em>Fer</em> (The Short Prophecy), the shorter of the two adaptive Welsh translations of the <em>Prophecy of the Six Kings </em> as it appears in <a href="https://viewer.library.wales/4389453#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0">Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, Peniarth MS 54 i</a> (see<strong><em> Prophecy of the Six Kings</em> </strong>). Mostyn 133 is beyond the historical scope of the current project (and so is omitted from the database), but is worth noting also for its cross border history as concerns the copying of Welsh materials in England. It is written in the autograph hand of John Jones of Gelli Lyvdy (1606-28), and may have been produced in London while Jones was imprisoned for debt in Fleet prison (in which context a great deal of his scribal activity is understood to have taken place).<a title="" name="_ftnref11" >[11]</a> </p><p> </p><p>The <em>Crossing Borders</em> database includes the five <em>Brutiau</em> containing the <em>Prophetiae </em> analysed by Brynley F.

A brief English verse translation of <em>Prophetiae, </em> 110-14 (known as the ‘Breton hope’) is found on two fifteenth-century fly leaves bound into the diary of the eighteenth-century antiquary, Thomas Hearne; and a longer section is interpolated in Thomas Castleford’s fourteenth-century <em>Chronicle – </em> although this remains unstudied.</p><p> </p><p>The one fully attested Middle English translation and commentary of the <em>Prophetiae </em> is difficult to date with any precision, although the manuscript in which it appears is dated c. 1450-75, and is understood to have been produced in Oxfordshire. The text has been edited by Eckhardt, with extensive critical apparatus.<a title="" name="_ftnref27" >[27]</a> Eckhardt has understood the text to be the work of a translator and commentator (if we assume these to be the same individual) acquainted with the Middle English <em>Brut, </em> and indeed, it may have been intended for insertion in a <em>Brut. </em> The Middle English <em>Bruts </em> contain the <em>Six Kings </em> rather than the <em>Prophetiae, </em> and the latter was superseded by the former in its English language circulation. However, there is precedent for the re-insertion of the <em>Prophetiae </em> in French-language <em>Bruts, </em> with commentary – although this remains an area where fuller study is required.<a title="" name="_ftnref28" >[28]</a> (This confirms one of the hypotheses of the <em>Crossing Borders </em> pilot project – that the transmission and translation histories of the <em>Prophetiae </em> and the <em>Six Kings </em> might be profitably read together). Although a production of the Wars of the Roses, interest in the <em>Prophetiae </em> appears to have been historiographical rather than political, and no contemporary political figures are mentioned in the commentary. However, the integration of the first prophecy of the <em>Six Kings</em> as the final component of the text, identifying Henry III as the lamb of Winchester, may imply an association of Henry IV with the mole – an identification which questions the legitimacy of the Lancastrian claim. </p><p><em> </em> </p><p>The <em>Prophetiae </em> follow a brief allusion, from <em>Historia </em> XI (presumably via the <em>Brut</em> ), to the conquest of Britain by the African King Gormund following the invitation of the Saxons, the establishment of the Heptarchy, and the contraction of British power to Cornwall and Brittany (Wales is here omitted, as in the Middle English <em>Brut</em>, presumably because its production post-dates the 1282 Conquest of Wales). An account of Augustine’s conversion of the Saxons follows, which inspires the first prophecies of the text, a loose translation from line 46 of the <em>Prophetiae </em> onwards, read as concerning the relationship between insular archbishoprics and Rome. The account of Gormund and the Augustinian conversion is a very truncated version of these episodes as found in the Middle English <em>Brut</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref29" >[29]</a> Given the fragmentary state of the manuscript, it is difficult to tell whether earlier passages from the <em>Prophetiae </em> have been lost or were omitted. If the latter, the relevant part of the <em>Prophetiae </em> (excluding the career of Arthu) was understood to begin with the establishment of the Heptarchy and the first Christian Saxon kings. Notably, all references to British restoration in the Latin prophecies are omitted from the English translation. </p><p> </p><p>The prophecies that follow are those understood by the commentator to trace a king list, from Egbryt to Henry III, although distinct reigns are treated (as the <em>Prophetiae </em> demand) with varying levels of attention. The Middle English commentary is for the most part in line with earlier Latin commentaries, although the ‘Ue tibi neustria’ prophecy (itself probably a later insertion in the <em>Prophetiae</em>) is understood to refer to Richard I rather than (as more commonly) Henry I. Similarly, John is regarded as <em>Sextus, </em> the conqueror of Ireland. The latter is more usually applied to Henry II, and positive prophetic associations with John are relatively rare (although we do find this on one occasion in the writings of Gerald of Wales). The final prophecy of the sequence taken from <em>Prophetiae,</em> the prophecy of a lynx (here a ‘beest’) of feeble sight who will damage his people, is applied to Henry III on account of his bad eyesight and the dissension of his barons. The original prophecy, which in its full form (here excluded) includes a prediction of the cession of Normandy, is more frequently applied to John (who ceded the territory in 1210),  but certainly elsewhere saw some measure of application to Henry III, who in the 1259 Treaty of Paris made final the losses of John’s reign.<a title="" name="_ftnref30" >[30]</a> However, this is not mentioned by the commentator. Eckhardt has suggested that the positive representation of John and the negative representation of Henry (by this period both relatively distant historical figures) may owe something to a general desire to present paralleled good and bad figures of rule; and a particular association of John, who was born in Woodstock, with Oxfordshire (if we can assume this to be the provenance of the translation and commentary). </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></strong></p><p>The obvious outlier in the transmission and translation history of the <em>Prophetiae </em> is its movement into Middle English, which is late when compared to French, Welsh and Norse – although we might note that the highest volume of manuscripts containing Continental French translations are similarly late, dating to the fifteenth century. This is not to say that Galfridian material had a limited influence on English historiography (indeed, it is the very basis of the English historiographical tradition), rather in an English language literary context this influence appears to have been mediated through the <em>Brut </em> which, in the English tradition, excised the <em>Prophetiae </em> in favour of the <em>Six Kings. </em> The sole English translation does, however, make clear that for Latinate readers the two prophecies were understood as operating in a close conceptual relationship.</p><p> </p><p>Three significant areas for future research remain: 1) the possibility of a French-language precedent for the Middle English translation, as it operates in relation to the <em>Brut</em> ; 2) the extent of the circulation of the <em>Prophetiae </em> in the Low Countries in the context of the Hundred Years War; and 3) the relationship between the political contexts of the <em>Prophetiae</em> in Wales and France – both of which draw on the oppositional capabilities of Geoffrey’s original text. It is possible that this commonality may owe something to the Cambro-French alliances of the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. If so, this is suggestive of a line of direct influence which excludes English political culture, informing the cross-border uses of a foundational English political text. It demands further investigation. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle">EDITIONS</strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Anglo-Norman Translation</span></strong></p><p>Blacker, Jean, ed. and transl., <em>Anglo-Norman Prophecies of Merlin </em> (Dallas, Texas: Scriptorium Press, 2005)</p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Continental French Translation</span></strong></p><p>Géraldine Veysseyre, ‘Translater Geoffrey de Monmouth: trois traductions en prose française de l’<em>Historia regum Britannie (xiiie-xve siècle</em> )’, thèse de doctorat, Université de Paris IV-Sorbonne, 2002</p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Old Norse-Icelandic Translation</span></strong></p><p>Jónsson, Finnur, ed.,<em>Merlínússpá</em> ’, in <em>Hauksbók </em> (Copenhagen: Thiele, 1892-96), pp.272-83</p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Welsh Translation</span></strong></p><p>Lewis, Henry, ed., <em>Brut Dingestow</em> (Cardiff: Gwasg Pryfisgol Cymru, 1942)</p><p> </p><p>Parry, John Jay, ed. and transl., <em>Brut y Brenhinedd: Cotton Cleopatra Version </em> (Cambridge, Mass., 1937)</p><p> </p><p>Rhys, John, and J.G.

			"significance": '<p>The Latin <em>Elucidarium</em> (or <em>Elucidarius, Lucidarius</em> ) is a handbook of religious instruction in the form of a pacey dialogue between a student and teacher, in which common questions about the Christian Faith are matched with simple and undemanding answers. The <em>Elucidarium</em> was composed in Latin near the turn of the twelfth century, its authorship is uncertainly attributed to Honorius Augustodunensis (b. 1075-80, d. 1156), a theologian and populariser of religious learning figure about whom we know little.<a title="" name="_ftnref1" >[1]</a> For students, its three books provided a rudimentary <em>summa</em> of Christian teachings on the nature of God, salvation through the church, and Christian eschatology, while for teachers it provided a store of concise and uncomplicated answers to common questions. ‘How can one God be a trinity?’ ‘Where does God live?’ ‘If God is called glory and kindness, why do we call him ‘father’ and not ‘mother”? ‘Why do some wicked men live long and some good men die young?’<a title="" name="_ftnref2" >[2]</a> Its perspective on these challenging theological questions is seldom subtle or convoluted, but has been characterised, variously, as concise and undemanding, crude and naive.<a title="" name="_ftnref3" >[3]</a> </p><p> </p><p>The composition of the <em>Elucidarium</em> was timely with a new vogue for encyclopaedias, single-volume anthologies of statements from authoritative authors on diverse religious and natural philosophical subjects. The formal structure provided by the dialogue format rendered itopen to tailoring and alteration, and some of the questions added may have strayed from religious themes. For example, in the Castilian translation of the<em>Elucidarium</em>, composed in around 1293, the student asks ‘Why does it damage trees to strip off their bark but not the cork tree?’<a title="" name="_ftnref4" >[4]</a> </p><p> </p><p>The <em>Elucidarium </em> was evidently a work of enduring popularityacross high and late medieval Europe, surviving in hundreds of manuscripts. One of the ways the <em>Elucidarius</em> was made undemanding to its audiences was thorough its translation into local languages.<a title="" name="_ftnref5" >[5]</a> In a four-hundred year period, itwas translated into languages including Old Norse-Icelandic, Continental and Insular French, Old and Middle English, Middle Welsh, Middle High German, Provençal, Occitan, Castillian, and Czech.</p><p> </p><p>The present survey is based on the following translations:</p><p> </p><p>-      <em>Elucidarius</em> (Old Norse-Icelandic), two independent translations (earliest <em>c. </em>  1200?).</p><p>-      <em>Elucidarium</em> (Old English), two excerpts in the same manuscript but by separate hands, but likely the work of the same translator (manuscript s. XII mid)</p><p>-      <em>Lucidarie</em> (Middle English),A Middle English translation with numerous interpolations (s. XIV in)</p><p>-      <em>Lucistrye</em> (Middle English), A Middle English translation related to the <em>Lucidarie</em>, but less careful and complete (s. XV in)</p><p>-      <em>Abbreviated Middle English Elucidarium</em> (Middle English), an English translation of the  <em>Elucidarium</em> from a Latin original (s XV ex)</p><p>-       <em>Ystoria Lucidar</em> (Middle Welsh), (s. XIII ex / XIV in)</p><p>-      <em>The Lucydarye </em> (Middle English), a late Middle English translation of the French <em>Second Lucidaire </em> extant in two print versions, published 1502-4 and ?1523.</p><p> </p><p>Its Insular transmission cannot be understood in isolation from its wider Continental transmission. As manuscript examples assembled by Huw Grange show, the <em>Elucidarium</em> circulated within England in both Continental and Insular varieties of French. For example, Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 652 (s. XIII 2) and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Douce 270 (s.XIII mid, for Wells Cathedral in Somerset?) both contain the Old French <em>Lucidaire I</em> among other items in Latin, Middle English and Insular French.<a title="" name="_ftnref6" >[6]</a> When the <em>Elucidarium</em> appeared in print in a Middle English translation, <em>The Lucydarye </em> (1502-04, ?1523), the translator did not base his translation on the original Latin text – or one of the pre-existing English translations - but on an earlier French translation.</p><p> </p><p>There is a tendency in Insular manuscripts for compilers to bring together various versions of this enormously popular work.A vernacular translation of a work did not necessarily displace the Latin original, but may have circulated with it. For example, Latin and Insular French versions of the Elucidarium are preserved side-by-side in London, Lambeth Palace Library, MS 431 (s. XIII in), the Latin text (ff. 183r–210v) immediately preceding the<em>Lucidaire III</em> (ff. 210v–238v).<a title="" name="_ftnref7" >[7]</a> Having acquired a fragmentary version of a popular work, a compositor may have sought a more complete version, or, in multilingual insular environments, a complementary translation into another language. Two Old Norse versions of the <em>Elucidarium</em> – one fragmentary, and one fuller witness – likely circulated together in the single-volume library substitute known as Hauksbók (now Copenhagen, Arnamagnæan Institute, AM 544 4to and AM 675 4to), compiled for the Icelandic statesman Haukr Erlendsson (d. 1334). One English and two Welsh translations of the <em>Elucidarium</em> circulated together in Abersytwyth, National Library of Wales, MS Peniarth 12, a composite manuscript containing texts written by four hands between <em>c. </em> 1400 and the 1580s. The compilation includes a fragmentary Welsh translation, the <em>Ystoria Lucidar</em>, written <em>c. </em> 1400, which the book’s sixteenth-century owner, Hugh Evans, also supplemented with readings from another Welsh translation to create a ‘complete’ text. This hybrid Welsh text was additionally bound with an abbreviated Middle English <em>Elucidarium</em>, written <em>c. </em> 1475-1500.</p><p> </p><p>The manuscript compilations containing versions of the <em>Elucidarium</em> intwo languages – Latin and French, English and Welsh – reveal much about the Insular mobility of popular works, and the multilingual environments through which they moved. An inclusive view of the movements of these texts across national and linguistic borders enables a deeper understanding of the literary cultures that produced them.</p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">English Transmission</span></strong></p><p>The <em>Elucidarium</em> was translated into Old English within a few years of its completion, appearing alongside homiletic, hagiographic and instructive material in London, British Library, MS Cotton Vespasian D. xiv, ff. 159r-163v and 163v-165r  (s. XII med, ?Christ Church, Canterbury, England).<a title="" name="_ftnref8" >[8]</a> The translation comprises two excerpts of selected dialogical units from the second and the first book of the <em>Elucidarium</em> (in that order). The questions chosen from the second book (a condensed translation of chapters 1-6) concerns the nature of Sin, and the earthly fortunes of the good and the sinful; while the later selection from the first book (a condensed translation of chapters 23-25) concerns the resurrection and ascension. The two pieces, probably the original work of the same translator but written here in two different hands, are separated by red and green decoration. The manuscript comprises items written mostly in the vernacular Old English.<a title="" name="_ftnref9" >[9]</a>         </p><p> </p><p>The <em>Elucidarium</em> underwent at least two translations from Latin into Middle English.<a title="" name="_ftnref10" >[10]</a> One translation, known as<em>Lucistrye</em>, is preserved a compendium of religious items written primarily in English with some Latin in St John\'s College, Cambridge, MS G.25, fols. 1r-16r, s. XV in.<a title="" name="_ftnref11" >[11]</a> The translation follows closely the structure of the Latin <em>Elucidarium</em> as far as the beginning of its second book, but then contains only six questions from the second book, and omits the third altogether. This translation is related to the version in Cambridge University Library, MS ii.vi.26, fols. 79v-101v (s. XV in) called <em>Lucidaire</em> .This manuscript contains a number of tracts advocating the Bible’s translation into English.<a title="" name="_ftnref12" >[12]</a> This translation is related to, but is generally less conscientious and complete than, the translation in St John’s College, Cambridge, MS G.25, and it is likely that the two originated in a common exemplar.                                                                                                                      </p><p>The <em>Abbreviated Middle English Elucidarium</em> has been considerably adapted and refocussed from its Latin original, and is preserved in Abersytwyth, National Library of Wales, MS Peniarth 12 (previously Hengwrt 202), ff. 1r-11v (s. XV 3/4). The section containing the English <em>Elucidarium </em> was written by an unknown scribe from Worcestershire or (more likely) South Herefordshire, which suits its later inclusion in a manuscript containing Welsh language texts.<a title="" name="_ftnref13" >[13]</a> The translation seems to have been translated from Latin recently to its copying in this manuscript.<a title="" name="_ftnref14" >[14]</a> Of the 368 chapters in the Lefèvre’s Latin edition, 120 have Middle English counterparts in this version. The text seems never to have been finished, ending in the middle of a sentence with space remaining on the folio.<a title="" name="_ftnref15" >[15]</a> This Middle English translation is bound into a complex composite manuscript that bears the inscription ‘llyfr Hugh Evans yw hwn Anno 1583’ (‘This is Hugh Evans\'s Book, 1583’).<a title="" name="_ftnref16" >[16]</a> The manuscript contains texts written by four hands, between <em>c.</em> 1400 and<em>c. </em> 1580. On the blank leaves that follow it, the manuscript’s compilator (Hugh Evans?) has copied numerous Welsh language religious writings, beginning with a Welsh translation of the <em>Elucidarium</em>, the <em>Ystoria Lucidar</em> (a translation from Latin, not the preceding English version) on folios 12-38, 39-58, and 67-73. At the end of the Middle English <em>Elucidarium</em>, Hugh Evans has written a marginal note reading ‘finis angli’ (‘the English [version] finishes’).<a title="" name="_ftnref17" >[17]</a> The inclusion of a Middle English <em>Elucidarium</em> (c. 1475-1500) seems to have stimulated by the compositor’s possession of a Welsh translation, the <em>Ystoria Lucidar</em> (<em>c.</em> 1400, and supplemented <em>c. </em> 1580).</p><p> </p><p>The <em>Elucidarium</em> ’s transmission in English translation was not halted by the advent of print technologies. The <em>Lucydarye</em> was printed by the London-based publisher Wynkyn de Worde (d. 1534) in 1502-04 and ?1523.<a title="" name="_ftnref18" >[18]</a> The translator, Andrew Chertsey (fl. 1502-27), did not base his translation on the original Latin text – or one of the pre-existing English translations - but on the French <em>Second Lucidaire</em> .The younger version was set up directly from a copy of the elder.<a title="" name="_ftnref19" >[19]</a> The elder version(1502-04) survives in only one copy (ESTC 13685.5, Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington DC).<a title="" name="_ftnref20" >[20]</a> The younger version (1523?), containing 12 woodcut illustrations from four designs, also survives in only one copy (ESTC 13686, British Library Print (Br)).<a title="" name="_ftnref21" >[21]</a> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Icelandic Transmission</span></strong></p><p>The Old Norse <em>Elucidarius</em> survives in eight manuscript witnesses, none of which preserve a complete text.<a title="" name="_ftnref22" >[22]</a> Three manuscripts cover what exists of the translation – AM 674a 4to, AM 675 4to, and AM 238 fol. XVIII (all in Copenhagen’s Arnamagnæan Institute) – with a single passage drawn from AM 544 4to.

This manuscript seems to have been copied by an Icelandic scribe living in Norway, possibly for inclusion in Hauksbók, an idiosyncratic compilation of sagas, historical writings, and items on natural philosophy commissioned, and partly written, by the Icelandic statesman Haukr Erlendsson (d. 1334).<a title="" name="_ftnref25" >[25]</a>   </p><p>If this text was written for inclusion in Hauksbók, it would be the second text of the <em>Elucidarium </em> in Haukr’s possession.

XIV in).<a title="" name="_ftnref26" >[26]</a> This section contains a diverse and idiosyncratic selection of texts including a version of the Eddic poem <em>Völuspá</em>, (ff. 22r-33v), the Icelandic <em>Breta sögur </em> (an Old Norse adaptation of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s <em>History of the Kings of Britain</em> ) including <em>Merlínusspá</em> (a verse translation of <em>Merlin’s Prophecy</em> ) (ff. 60r-68v). This fragmentary translation of the <em>Elucidarium </em> was copied by a (Norwegian?) scribe for Haukr, who then seems to have acquired a more complete version in AM 675 4to. The preeminent seventeenth-century collector of Icelandic manuscripts, Árni Magnússon, says that Hauksbók included <em>Elucidarius</em>, but the manuscript was taken apart after his death.

Its aim to elucidate the Faith and to render its teachings understandable compelled its translation into local languages, making it accessible to members of the lower clergy whose ability in Latin may have prevented them from accessing more advanced Latin <em>summæ</em> . Its vernacular translations also furnished preachers and teachers with a repertoire of responses to common questions in the local language. </p><p> </p><p>The Insular transmission of the <em>Elucidarium</em> and its vernacular issue challenges the writing of literary histories along national lines, showing how popular works cross national and linguistic borders. Manuscripts of English production contain versions of the <em>Elucidarium</em> written in Latin, Continental and Insular varieties of French, Welsh and English. In beginning to map the vernacular translations of a particularly mobile work like the <em>Elucidarium</em>, we are able to see that borders within – and, indeed, beyond – the Insular world were permeable. Manuscript books sometimes enacted the openness of these borders by including versions of the same work in multiple versions or languages.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle">EDITIONS</strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Old English</span></strong></p><p>Warner, Rubie D.

They are found inGreek, Syriac, Coptic, Arabic, Ethiopic, Armenian, Georgian, and Old Slavic;<a title="" name="_ftnref1" >[1]</a> and in Western Europe, they appear in multiple versions in Latin and many vernaculars. The transmission of this material is so broad that it lies beyond the scope of the present case study to list even only all the texts found across Britain, Ireland, and Iceland. For the time being the main focus of this entry of the database are the Welsh texts,<a title="" name="_ftnref2" >[2]</a> of which it intends to present a complete list. Irish data is also given as fully as possible, with content from other Insular languages included to give an indication of the material’s popularity. The list is not intended to be exhaustive (this would be beyond the scope of the current project), and none of the many Latin witnesses of the text are included, beyond the one known to have been produced in Ireland. The titles for most of the texts included in the database are provisional, since often no title in the modern sense is found in the manuscripts.</p><p> </p><p>The scholarship of this vast tradition has produced several classifications of the texts.

All the earlier Middle Welsh texts were identified as members of Tischendorf’s version B by J. E. Caerwyn Williams,<a title="" name="_ftnref16" >[16]</a> but this classification can now be refined. Haibach-Reinisch identified a textual subgroup B2, and it can be shown that the earlier Welsh texts belong to this group and show specific affinities with the <em>variae lectiones</em> found in one group of manuscripts. These are Paris,Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS lat 3522 (saec. xiv), Trinity College Dublin, MS C 2.14 (saec. xv), and Paris Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS lat 4974 (saec xv), all of which are later than the putative <em>ur</em> -translation of the Welsh version(s), associated with Madog ab Selyf and his patron Gruffudd ap Maredudd in the second half of the thirteenth century.<a title="" name="_ftnref17" >[17]</a> </p><p> </p><p>All the Welsh texts described above belong to one closely interrelated strand of transmission.

			"significance": '<p><p>The narrative of Alexander the Great had an extraordinarily wide dispersal throughout the Middle Ages, both in Europe and in the East. Originating in Greek, it spread rapidly in a wide variety of languages (Armenian, Georgian and Syriac, and later Latin, French, Castilian, English and Scots, to name but a few). As the medieval romance genre began to develop in the later Middle Ages, Alexander’s legend became a popular fictionalization opportunity, so that his adventures in the Orient were expanded with highly fictitious episodes. However, this broadly ‘romance’ tendency is known to have coexisted with more historicist approaches from a very early stage: for example, the earliest historical accounts, dating from Alexander’s lifetime (the third century BC) and the period immediately afterwards, were composed at the same moment as the so-called Greek <em>Alexander Romance</em>, which also dates from this century in its first form.<a title="" name="_ftnref1" >[1]</a> From its origins, then, Alexander’s narrative blends fact and fiction, and the later Middle Ages merely develop this tendency inherent from its origins. </p><p> </p><p>This blurred boundary does not, however, preclude a variety of approaches to Alexander. Historicist readings are also common, as are ethical ones, such as the first-century AD Latin account by Valerius Maximus, the <em>Memorable Deeds and Sayings</em>, which was epitomised by Julius Paris in the fourth century AD. By the later Middle Ages, therefore, those who were interested in Alexander in Britain (here referring primarily to England and Scotland) had a potentially wide range of material available to them in terms of extant accounts. Latin material of various kinds, but especially the <em>Historia de preliis</em>, and French romance works, such as the <em>Roman d’Alexandre</em>, were particularly important as sources for later Anglo-Norman and Middle English Alexander narratives.</p><p>Interest in Alexander in England in the pre-Conquest period is clearly demonstrated by the Old English translation of the Latin <em>Letter of Alexander to Aristotle</em>, which survives in the <em>c</em> . 1000 AD Nowell Codex (positioned immediately before <em>Beowulf</em> ). This prose narrative highlights the importance of Latin in Alexander’s early arrival in England, since it is not until the later 12th century that Alexander’s history reappears in the vernacular in these islands. Yet very little is known about this Latin transmission and circulation to date.<a title="" name="_ftnref2" >[2]</a> The Anglo-Norman <em>Roman de toute chevalerie</em>, which is based on both Latin and French material, was composed around 1175, drawing on mostly continental traditions and texts that were circulating in England, and in turn influences the Middle English <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> (<em>c</em> . 1300), for which it is the main source. This English work is followed by others in the 14th and 15th centuries (<em>Alexander A</em>, <em>Alexander B</em>,<em>Alexander C</em>, and the <em>Prose Life of Alexander</em> ) that appear to draw directly from Latin sources, in particular the <em>Historia de preliis</em> . So the story of Alexander’s transmission and translation in England is one of several independent reworkings into English and French from Latin, with (as far as is currently known) one example of direct translation between French (Anglo-Norman) and English. The Scottish situation appears to be similar, although in that case there is more direct use of French material. This picture demonstrates both the vital, if somewhat hidden, importance of Latin to insular Anglo-Norman and English Alexander works, and also the ongoing influence of originally continental French for later insular material.</p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle">Alexander in later medieval Ireland</span></strong></p><p class="p1">An Irish Alexander&nbsp;compilation, <span class="s1"><em>Sc&eacute;la Alaxandair</em></span> is found in the Book of Ballymote (Dublin, Royal Irish Academy MS 23 P 12), the Leabhar Breac (Dublin, Royal Irish Academy MS 23 P 16), and Oxford, Bodleian Library, Rawlinson&nbsp;MS&nbsp;B 512. Unlike so many Alexander texts, this work is not derived from the <span class="s1"><em>Historia de preliis</em></span>, but from a range of other Latin sources, including Orosius, <span class="s1"><em>Epistola Alexandri ad Aristotelem</em></span> and <span class="s1"><em>Collatio Alexandri cum Dindimo.</em></span> Since it stands apart from the romance tradition of texts and has traditionally been dated to the Middle Irish period (c. 900-c.1200), <span class="s1"><em>Sc&eacute;la Alaxandair</em></span> has not been included in the database. However, it is possible that it may be later and that its translator employed consciously archaic prose. U&aacute;it&eacute;ar Mac Gearailt highlights some evidence that the surviving fifteenth-century copies could&nbsp;descend from a common source of the fourteenth or possibly the thirteenth century, but notes that further work is required before any conclusions can be reached on this question.</p><p></p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Alexander in later medieval England</span></strong></p><p>The Alexander narrative in later medieval England appears to be well-known, as Chaucer’s Monk claims in <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> : </p><p> </p><p>The storie of Alisaundre is so commune</p><p>            That every wight that hath discrecioun</p><p>            Hath herd somwhat or al of his fortune.<a title="" name="_ftnref3" ><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> </p><p> </p><p>However, such knowledge of Alexander in Middle English must have been a recent phenomenon, and one that does not appear on the surviving textual evidence to have been particularly widely spread by the date of Chaucer’s comment. The Middle English romance <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> is the first extant work in that language, probably composed around 1300.<a title="" name="_ftnref4" >[4]</a> Its earliest witness is the Auchinleck Manuscript (Edinburgh, NLS, MS Advocates 19.2.1), written <em>c</em> . 1331–40.<a title="" name="_ftnref5" >[5]</a> </p><p> </p><p>During the second half of the fourteenth century <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> is joined by several alliterative Alexander texts (the fragments known as <em>Alexander A</em> and <em>Alexander B</em>, composed <em>c</em> .1340 and 1350 respectively), and <em>Alexander C</em> and the <em>Prose Life</em> of Alexander appear in the mid-15th century, post-dating the Chaucerian reference.<a title="" name="_ftnref6" >[6]</a> This relatively small body of material, mostly of a later date, does not seem aptly described by the adjective ‘commune’, particularly when the sparse manuscript evidence is assessed. <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> survives in two manuscripts besides Auchinleck, both of which date from the late 14th or early 15th centuries, again probably after Chaucer’s reference.<a title="" name="_ftnref7" >[7]</a> <em>Alexander A</em>, <em>Alexander B </em> and the <em>Prose Life</em> all survive in single manuscripts that date from the 15th century, and <em>Alexander C</em> is extant in two 15th-century copies.<a title="" name="_ftnref8" >[8]</a> Although this sparse manuscript history is not unusual for English romances, it does not support the idea of English-language Alexander works as being a staple diet of audiences and readers of that language in the later 14th century. </p><p> </p><p>Chaucer’s Monk’s suggestion that Alexander is ‘commune’, then, does not appear to fit the facts, at least with regard to English-language material. However, there is Alexander material that is extant in the earlier Middle Ages in England that may support a ‘commune’ perspective. Behind these later Middle English versions lie French and Latin Alexander works, material both composed in England and transmitted from the Continent. Together, these texts construct an ‘English’ Alexander picture that is multilingual and transnational, demonstrating how Alexander’s legend crosses borders.</p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">French Alexander material</span></strong></p><p>A major source for much Alexander material in the later Middle Ages is the <em>Roman d’Alexandre</em> compiled by Alexandre de Paris in the years after 1180.<a title="" name="_ftnref9" >[9]</a> The <em>Alexandre </em> as it now stands is based upon earlier French works (now mostly lost) that de Paris appears to have juxtaposed and re-versified.<a title="" name="_ftnref10" >[10]</a> Extant in <em>c</em> . 21 manuscripts, its textual history is still to be mapped out in detail, but it is suggestive that a deluxe copy is known to have been in England in the fifteenth century, when the Middle English text <em>Alexander B </em> was added to it.<a title="" name="_ftnref11" >[11]</a> The <em>Alexandre</em> is over 16,000 lines long, and gives a version of Alexander’s life from birth to death that includes many fantastical episodes concerned with the Orient (such as the discovery of the Fountain of Youth and submarine and aerial adventures), to which it devotes much of its third section. Its fictionalizing tendencies suited it well to developing romance discourses, which may explain the relatively large number of extant copies. </p><p> </p><p>The Anglo-Norman <em>Le roman de toute chevalerie</em> (<em>RTC</em> ), apparently composed by Thomas of Kent, does not display textual knowledge of the <em>Roman d’Alexandre</em>, although the two works were probably composed at much the same time.<a title="" name="_ftnref12" >[12]</a> This apparent independence from continental sources has allowed the <em>RTC</em> to be seen as a determinedly ‘insular’ production’.<a title="" name="_ftnref13" >[13]</a> However, both works use the same Latin sources (see section below), so they are participating in a textual culture focused upon Alexander that crosses the Channel. This shared culture is demonstrated by least one extant attempt at creating a merged text from them both. Extracts from branches II and IV of the <em>Alexandre</em>, concerning the ‘fuerre de Gadres’ and Alexander’s death, are found woven into the <em>RTC</em> ’s narrative without comment in all three of the latter’s complete (or near-complete) manuscripts, Durham Cathedral Library, MS C. IV. 27 B, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS fonds français 24364, and Cambridge, Trinity College, MS O.9.34 (1446), which date from the mid-13th and 14th centuries.<a title="" name="_ftnref14" >[14]</a> So although there is little known at present about the <em>Alexandre</em> ’s direct influence and circulation in England, it appears that a ‘hybrid’ Alexander narrative interpolating parts of the continentally-composed work into the <em>RTC</em> ’s text existed before the mid-13th century, probably at least one remove away from any of the three near-complete manuscripts that preserve it.<a title="" name="_ftnref15" >[15]</a> Given that the Durham and Cambridge manuscripts appear to have been copied and/or spent time at the monastery of St Albans in the mid-13th century,<a title="" name="_ftnref16" >[16]</a> this hybrid narrative may have been an insular production, but its composite nature suggests that any posited insular Alexander tradition is heavily dependent upon originally continental works.</p><p> </p><p>The <em>RTC</em>, however, differs from the <em>Alexandre</em> in its approach to some aspects of the Macedonian’s narrative. Although it follows the same chronological story, the section describing the East is less concerned with ‘marvels’ such as the Fountain of Youth, submarine and aerial adventures, being focused more closely on the strange peoples and animals that are such a strong feature of the <em>Letter of Alexander to Aristotle</em>, a text surviving in its Latin version from the seventh and tenth centuries.<a title="" name="_ftnref17" >[17]</a> It also displays a strongly encyclopaedic and instructive form of <em>translatio</em> that is unusual for a romance of this date.<a title="" name="_ftnref18" >[18]</a> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Latin material</span></strong></p><p>The situation with regard to Latin Alexander material is even more complex and less well-known. Charles Russell Stone has suggested that there is a specifically insular tradition of Alexander transmission and interpretation focused on St Albans, but more research is needed into this kind of localized reception and transmission.<a title="" name="_ftnref19" ><sup><sup>[19]</sup></sup></a> Latin texts are vital as the origins for much of the vernacular material discussed here, but also in their own right in both England and France; further, they demonstrate once again the porous nature of proto-national borders. For example, the <em>RTC</em>, also perhaps a product of St Albans, is based on Latin material that is also the ultimate origin for the <em>Alexandre</em> (behind the latter’s French texts), material that must have circulated widely in both France and England on this basis. Widely-circulated Latin Alexander texts including the <em>Epitome</em> of Julius Valerius, the <em>Letter of Alexander to Aristotle</em> and the <em>Historia de preliis</em> are sources for both the <em>RTC</em> and the <em>Alexandre</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref20" >[20]</a> The <em>Historia de preliis</em>, extant in three main versions (J1, J2 and J3) that date from pre-1100 to before 1236, is particularly important, since the J2 and J3 versions are sources for not only these two French texts, but also for <em>Alexander A </em> and <em>Alexander B</em> (J2) and <em>Alexander C</em> and the <em>Prose Life of Alexander</em> (J3). Of 17 extant manuscripts now held in British libraries, eight have definite English provenance, with three more that may be insular productions.<a title="" name="_ftnref21" >[21]</a> Since most of the manuscripts of J2 and J3 are Italian in origin, these English productions may seem less important in terms of the overall picture of the text’s transmission history, but their existence demonstrates that the <em>Historia de preliis</em> was present and circulating in England during the period in which English-language Alexander narratives were being composed, and during which the <em>RTC</em> and the <em>Alexandre</em> were being brought together in the three manuscripts discussed above.</p><p> </p><p>Another Latin work that is important for Alexander’s narrative in England is also a 12th-century text, the <em>Alexandreis</em> of Walter of Châtillon. Like the <em>Alexandre</em>, it too was composed in continental France, probably at Reims, and finished in 1180, making it a chronological companion for both that work and for the first version of the <em>RTC</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref22" >[22]</a> The <em>Alexandreis</em> is, however, a very different work from either of the French texts, since it dispenses with the Oriental adventures and focuses on Alexander’s conquests in a style familiar from classical Latin epic (particularly Lucan and Statius). To date, little work has been done on the circulation of the epic in England, but it was certainly copied and in circulation in England from the 13th century.<a title="" name="_ftnref23" >[23]</a> Along with the French Alexander works discussed above, its presence is explicitly felt in the Middle English <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> .</p><p>            </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Kyng Alisaunder</span></strong></p><p>This complex web of French material, which is both ‘continental’ and ‘insular’ but crosses any such borders, and behind which in turn lie Latin works, is the textual background for the Middle English <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em>, which is the example of English-language Alexander material discussed in detail here. It is a romance that in contrast to other Middle English works of comparable date does not seem to engage with issues of ‘Englishness’ in terms of cultural identity, and is diction is notably French.<a title="" name="_ftnref24" >[24]</a> This may in part be due to the nature of this web of French and Latin material as well as to the character of Alexander’s narrative, which does not lend itself to easy insular localization. The main narrative source for <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> is the <em>RTC</em>, but the English-language work also draws on the <em>Alexandreis</em>, apparently for narrative ‘coloure’.<a title="" name="_ftnref25" >[25]</a> So despite its English linguistic nature, <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> is very much a transnational text in its textual relationships and its approach to the act of <em>translatio</em> .</p><p> </p><p>This concept of <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> as transnational is intriguing, given the text’s presence (unfortunately now fragmentary) in the Auchinleck manuscript, Edinburgh, National Library of Scotland, MS Advocates’ 19.2.1. This anthology is often interpreted holistically in terms of cultural and linguistic ‘Englishness’, a conceptual framework within which <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> sits uneasily, given its different nature, and potentially a framework that the Alexander romance’s presence challenges.<a title="" name="_ftnref26" >[26]</a> Beyond questions of ‘Englishness’, Auchinleck is part of an apparent London network of manuscripts that feature <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> . London, Lincoln’s Inn, MS 150 and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Laud misc. 622 both contain the romance. Lincoln 150 was copied in the first quarter of the 15th century in a Shropshire dialect, but possibly used London exemplars.<a title="" name="_ftnref27" >[27]</a> Interestingly, its version of <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> has been edited: some of its more ‘literary’ aspects, such as its seasonal headpieces, have been removed, possibly to make the romance more performative.<a title="" name="_ftnref28" >[28]</a> Laud 622 is the longest witness, similar to Auchinleck according to Ralph Hanna (although now incomplete), and reflecting parallel literary tastes and possible audience.<a title="" name="_ftnref29" >[29]</a> It dates from the end of the 14th century.<a title="" name="_ftnref30" >[30]</a> It seems, then, that <em>Kyng Alisaunder</em> may have had a London provenance and/or circulation in the later 14th and early 15th centuries, which provides some context for its relatively unusual cultural identity, since London was a linguistic and cultural melting pot as well as a centre for the development of English as a literary language.</p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Alexander in Scotland</span></strong></p><p>The Alexander legend played a key role both in expanded form and as a point of allusion in fifteenth and sixteenth century Scotland and had a particular cultural and political resonance for Scottish audiences.<a title="" name="_ftnref31" >[31]</a> During the Anglo-Scots Wars of Independence in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Scottish writers developed an already nascent origin myth to counter that of the English, who traced their origins via King Arthur to Brutus and his Trojan ancestors. This Trojan origin myth was subsequently exploited by Edward I and Edward II (and indeed by later English monarchs) to bolster their claim to lordship and ownership of Scotland. To oppose this, and instead affirm Scotland’s independence and sovereignty, Scottish historians traced their origins to a Greek prince, Gaythelos, and his Egyptian wife, Scota. In doing so, the Scots implicitly claimed a shared ancestry too with Alexander the Great.<a title="" name="_ftnref32" >[32]</a> </p><p> </p><p>This political interest in the Alexander tradition no doubt explains the appearance of Alexander, and allusions to his legend, in a wide variety of Older Scots literature, including the chronicles of John of Fordun,<a title="" name="_ftnref33" >[33]</a> Walter Bower,<a title="" name="_ftnref34" >[34]</a> and Andrew of Wyntoun,<a title="" name="_ftnref35" >[35]</a> and well-known literary works such as John Barbour’s <em>Bruce</em>,<a title="" name="_ftnref36" >[36]</a> Blind Hary’s <em>Wallace</em>,<a title="" name="_ftnref37" >[37]</a> and Gavin Douglas’ <em>Palice of Honour</em> .<a title="" name="_ftnref38" >[38]</a> It also features in romances and quasi-romances such as the anonymous <em>Lancelot of the Laik </em> (1460s),<a title="" name="_ftnref39" >[39]</a> <em>Clariodus </em> (c. 1503-50),<a title="" name="_ftnref40" >[40]</a> David Lyndsay’s <em>Squyer Meldrum</em>,<a title="" name="_ftnref41" >[41]</a> and John Stewart of Baldynneis’ <em>Roland Furious </em> (c. 1576-86),<a title="" name="_ftnref42" >[42]</a> as well as inless familiar texts such as ‘The Baris Tale’ in <em>The Talis of the Fyve Bestes </em> (lines 289-368), <em>The Sex Werkdayis and Agis </em> (p. 322, lines 29-30; p. 323, lines 1-5), <em>The Buke of the Chess</em> (lines 151-74, 359-60, 868-71, 1000-33) and <em>The Contemplacioun of Synnaris </em> (line 562), all contained within the Asloan Manuscript (Edinbugh, National Library of Scotland, MS 16500) compiled by the Edinburgh notary and scribe, John Asloan, between 1510 and 1530.<a title="" name="_ftnref43" >[43]</a> Alexander appears variously in the latter texts to illustrate the virtue largesse or its opposed vice avarice. </p><p> </p><p>He also appears in several Scottish texts as one of the Nine Worthies. The most significant example of this is the <em>Balletis of the Nine Nobles </em> (c. 1438-47); in this short poem a stanza of six lines is devoted to ach of the Worthies, including Alexander, and a tenth stanza is appended claiming Robert I (the Bruce) (1274-1329) as tenth worthy.<a title="" name="_ftnref44" >[44]</a> Stanzas on the Nine Worthies occur within numerous other Older Scots works, including the late fifteenth-century alliterative romance <em>Golagros and Gawane</em>,<a title="" name="_ftnref45" >[45]</a> and they are often used here to illustrate the changeable nature of fortune and the transience of earthly life. </p><p> </p><p>In addition to historical and literary references to Alexander, there is evidence for ownership of Alexander material. A volume (now Cambridge, University Library, Inc. 3. E. 1. 4 [2787]) containing a copy of the <em>Historia Alexandri </em> printed c. 1470 in the Netherlands was owned one Henry Barry, rector of Collace.<a title="" name="_ftnref46" >[46]</a> A 1578 inventory of books in Edinburgh Castle includes a volume of ‘Thre Lyves of Alexander the Greit and utheris nobles’,<a title="" name="_ftnref47" >[47]</a> whilst copies of the ‘Vowis of Alexander’ are recorded amongst the possessions of the Edinburgh bookbinder Robert Gourlaw in his will of 1586, and also in the will of the printer and publisher Henry Charteris who died in 1601.<a title="" name="_ftnref48" >[48]</a> </p><p> </p><p>Most interestingly, the Bodleian library’s famous copy of the <em>Roman d’Alexandre </em> (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 264),<a title="" name="_ftnref49" >[49]</a> has also been linked to Scotland. Mark Cruse suggests that the manuscript was commissioned by the French king Philippe VI (r. 1328 to 1350), under whose protection the Scottish king, David II (1324-1371), and his wife, Queen Joan (1321-1362) were kept from 1334 to 1361.<a title="" name="_ftnref50" >[50]</a> However, the use throughout the manuscript of <em>arms, or, a lion rampant gules</em>, either borne on Alexander’s shield or on flags (e.g. fols 51v, 56r, 58r, 59r et passim), led E.W.B. Nicolson to suggest that the manuscript might have been made for David II of Scotland (who was indeed in France around the time of the manuscript\'s production) because Alexander’s blazon is the same as ‘the royal Scottish shield all but the double tressure flory counter-flory gules’.<a title="" name="_ftnref51" >[51]</a> Further analysis of this theory is needed.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, there also exist two Older Scots Alexander romances: the octosyllabic <em>Buik of King Alexander </em> (also known as the <em>Octosyllabic Alexander</em> ), internally dated to 1438, and the decasyllabic <em>Buik of King Alexander the Conquerour</em>, ascribed to the Scottish knight, cleric and author, Sir Gilbert Hay (born c. 1397, d. after 1465), and dated to c. 1460 (with possible scribal revision c. 1499). The first romance, running to c. 14500 lines, is a translation into Scots octosyllabic couplets of two episodes within the <em>Roman d’Alexandre</em> ; it survives uniquely in a printed edition of c. 1580 produced by the Edinburgh printer, Alexander Arbuthnot (STC 321.5).<a title="" name="_ftnref52" >[52]</a> The first half of the poem, ‘The Forray of Gadderis’, is a translation of the French <em>Le Fuerre de Gadres</em>, originally an independent episode at the beginning of Branch II of the <em>Roman</em> . It details a foraging expedition to the Vale of Josaphas led by Emenidus, one of Alexander’s <em>douze pers</em> . The Greeks come under attack and Emenidus strives in vain to convince his men to deliver a message to Alexander asking for help. After much slaughter a message is eventually taken to Alexander who then rescues his men and leads them to victory. The second half of the poem – comprising ‘The Avowis of Alexander’ and ‘The Great Battell of Effesovn’ – is a translation of <em>Les Voeux du Paon</em>, originally an independent poem composed c. 1310-12 by Jacques de Longuyon for Thibaut de Bar, bishop of Liège. It was the most common of the French Alexander poems and survives in over thirty manuscripts where it is often appended to the <em>Roman d’Alexandre</em>, or interpolated within Branch III of that romance. The poem begins with Alexander wandering alone one morning. He meets an old hermit who is revealed to be Cassamus, brother of Gadifer to Larys, a worthy knight slain by Emenidus during the ‘Forray’. Cassamus tells Alexander of Gadifer’s children and the assault on their city by the Indian king, Clarus. Alexander promises to assist them to make amends for Gadifer’s death, and the remainder of the poem is broadly structured around his attempts to do so. Its narrative fluctuates between events on the battlefield and more courtly episodes within Epheon’s aristocratic chambers. </p><p> </p><p>Sir Gilbert Hay’s <em>Buik of King Alexander the Conquerour </em> is a romance of over 19000 decasyllabic lines that offers a full biography of Alexander’s career, conquests and death.<a title="" name="_ftnref53" >[53]</a> It supplements its main source, the second recension of the Latin <em>Historia de preliis</em>, by drawing not only upon the Old French <em>Roman d’Alexandre</em>, and interpolations to it such as the <em>Voeux du Paon </em> and <em>Voyage d’Alexandre</em> <em>au Paradis terrestre</em>, but also upon the pseudo-Aristotelian <em>Secretum Secretorum</em>, the <em>Lai d’Aristote</em>, and several pieces of otherwise-independent Older Scots conduct literature. The text (now acephalous) survives in two late sixteenth-century manuscript witnesses: London, British Library, MS Additional 40732,<a title="" name="_ftnref54" >[54]</a> and Edinburgh, National Records of Scotland, MS GD 112/71/9.<a title="" name="_ftnref55" >[55]</a> Most study of the romance has focused on its sources,<a title="" name="_ftnref56" >[56]</a> and on its representation of Alexander’s encounters with other cultures,<a title="" name="_ftnref57" >[57]</a> with Anna Caughey and Emily Wingfield most recently situating this in the wider context of Older Scots Alexander literature, detecting in that an intriguing strand of proto-postcolonial sentiment.<a title="" name="_ftnref58" >[58]</a> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></strong></p><p>Oxford, Bodleian Library MS 264 – with its deluxe copy of the <em>Roman d’Alexandre</em>, the Middle English <em>Alexander B </em> and a copy of Marco Polo’s <em>Li Livres du Graunt Caam</em>, in French prose – epitomises much about the Middle English and Older Scots Alexander tradition discussed in this introduction. Although originally produced in France, and perhaps commissioned by the French king Philippe VI, it is possible that the manuscript might also have been made for the Scottish king, David II and it later became the property of several English aristocratic owners. The manuscript’s triple French, English and Scottish association complements both the ready availability of French (and Latin) Alexander material in England and Scotland from the Xth centuryand the use of shared source material in both the Middle English and Older Scots versions of the Alexander legend (including the <em>Roman d’Alexandre </em> itself, and the <em>Historia de Preliis</em> ). The manuscript’s additional contents further reflect an interest in Alexander’s encounters with other cultures common to both sides of the Border, whilst the (textual and visual) presentation of Alexander as a model king speaks to the strongly advisory focus of the Scottish Alexander legend and to the encyclopaedic and instructional nature of the <em>RTC</em> . In sum, Bodleian Library MS 264 speaks to the way in which Alexander material crossed a variety of porous borders in the medieval period – both the Continental borders between France and England, and France and Scotland, as well as the insular border between England and Scotland. In the later period, the transmission of material and circulation of common texts clearly took place not just despite, but also perhaps because of, the periods of conflict between the different countries. Indeed, the story of the translation and transmission of Alexander material in England and Scotland in the later medieval period is at once both national (with Scottish historians in particular putting the Alexander legend to notably political and proto-nationalist uses) but also trans-national, once more testifying to the importance of looking beyond the confined geographical boundaries of traditional literary history.</p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p><strong class="subtitle"> </strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong class="subtitle">EDITIONS</strong></p><p><p></p><em> </em> </p><p><strong class="subtitle"><span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;">Middle English</span></strong></p><p><em>Alexander A = The Romance of Alisaunder</em>, ed.
