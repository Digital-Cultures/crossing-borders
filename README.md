The easiest way to import the excel into a mysql database is to import into google sheets and then export as a tsv file. Rename this file as a csv one then you can use mysql Workbench importer.

## Dev

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.5.

## Development server

At present the DB files are just exported as json files to make the dev setup easier.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build -w` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
